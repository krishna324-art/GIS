Moreover, maps \\nof the twenty-first century are not just paper diagrams folded like an accordion. Maps today are \\ncolorful, searchable, interactive, and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and \\ninteractive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of \\ngeographic data. The key technology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the \\ntwenty-first century, is geographic information systems or GIS. \\nPut simply, GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from \\nvarious sources as maps. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of \u201cwhere\u201d has \\ntaken on new meaning. From getting directions to a new restaurant in San Francisco on your mobile \\ndevice to exploring what will happen to coastal cities like Venice if oceans were to rise due to global \\nwarming, GIS provides insights into daily tasks and the big challenges of the future. \\nEssentials of Geographic Information Systems integrates key concepts behind the technology with \\npractical concerns and real-world applications. Recognizing that many potential GIS users are \\nnonspecialists or may only need a few maps, this book is designed to be accessible, pragmatic, and \\nconcise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask \\nquestions, inform choices, and guide policy. From the melting of the polar ice caps to privacy issues \\nassociated with mapping, this book provides a gentle, yet substantive, introduction to the use and \\napplication of digital maps, mapping, and GIS. \\nIn today\\'s world, learning involves knowing how and where to search for information. In some \\nrespects, knowing where to look for answers and information is arguably just as important as the \\nknowledge itself. Because Essentials of Geographic Information Systems is concise, focused, and \\ndirected, readers are encouraged to search for supplementary information and to follow up on \\nspecific topics of interest on their own when necessary. Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems provides the foundations for learning GIS, but readers are encouraged to construct their \\nown individual frameworks of GIS knowledge. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. First, it Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  3 \\npromotes active learning through research. Second, it facilitates flexible and selective learning\u2014 that \\nis, what is learned is a function of individual needs and interest. \\nSince GIS and related geospatial and navigation technology change so rapidly, a flexible and dynamic \\ntext is necessary in order to stay current and relevant. Though essential concepts in GIS tend to \\nremain constant, the situations, applications, and examples of GIS are fluid and dynamic. Though \\nthis book is intended for use in introductory GIS courses, Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems will also appeal to the large number of certificate, professional, extension, and online \\nprograms in GIS that are available today. In addition to providing readers with the tools necessary to \\ncarry out spatial analyses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems outlines valuable \\ncartographic guidelines for maximizing the visual impact of your maps. The book also describes \\neffective GIS project management solutions that commonly arise in the modern workplace.

Knowing something about where something happens can \\nhelp us to understand what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and why it happened. \\nWhether it is an outbreak of a highly contagious disease, the discovery of a new frog species, the path of a \\ndeadly tornado, or the nearest location of a supermarket, knowing something about where things happen \\nis important to how we understand and relate to our local environment and to the world at large.  \\nA geographic information system\u2014 or GIS\u2014 is a special type of information technology that can help us \\nunderstand and relate to the \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the world by answering \u201cwhere.\u201d \\nGeographic information systems are indeed about maps, but they are also about much, much more.  \\nA GIS is used to organize, analyze, visualize, and share all kinds of data and information from different \\nhistorical periods and at various scales of analysis. From climatologists trying to understand the causes \\nand consequences of global warming, to epidemiologists locating ground zero of a virulent disease \\noutbreak, to archaeologists reconstructing ancient Rome, to political consultants developing campaign \\nstrategies for the next presidential election, GIS is a very powerful tool.  \\nMore important, GIS is about geography and learning about the world in which we live. As GIS techno logy \\ndevelops, as society becomes ever more geospatially enabled, and as more and more people rediscover \\ngeography and the power of maps, the future uses and applications of GIS are unlimited.  \\nTo take full advantage of the benefits of GIS and related geospatial technology both now and in the future, \\nit is useful to take stock of the ways in which we already think spatially with respect to the world in which \\nwe live. In other words, by recognizing and increasing our geographical awareness about how we relate  to \\nour local environment and the world at large, we will benefit more from our use and application of GIS.  \\nThe purpose of this chapter is to increase our geographical awareness and to refine our spatial thinking. \\nFirst, a simple mental mapping exercise is used to highlight our geographical knowledge and spatial \\nawareness, or lack thereof. Second, fundamental concepts and terms that are central to geographic \\ninformation systems, and more generally geography, are identified, defined, and explained. This chap ter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  5 \\nconcludes with a description of the frameworks that guide the use and application of GIS, as well as its \\nfuture development. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  6 \\n1.1 Spatial Thinking \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to illustrate how we think geographically every day with mental maps and \\nto highlight the importance of asking geographic questions. \\nAt no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to create or to acquire a map of nearly \\nanything. Maps and mapping technology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the modes \\nand means of making and distributing maps have been revolutionized with recent advances in \\ncomputing like the Internet, the art and science of map making date back centuries. This is because \\nhumans are inherently spatial organisms, and in order for us to live in the world, we must first \\nsomehow relate to it. Enter the mental map. \\nMental Maps \\nMental or cognitive maps are psychological tools that we all use every day. As the name \\nsuggests, mental maps are maps of our environment that are stored in our brain. We rely on our mental \\nmaps to get from one place to another, to plan our daily activities, or to understand and situate events that \\nwe hear about from our friends, family, or the news. Mental maps also reflect the amount and ex tent of \\ngeographic knowledge and spatial awareness that we possess. To illustrate this point, pretend that a friend \\nis visiting you from out of town for the first time. Using a blank sheet of paper, take five to ten minutes to \\ndraw a map from memory of your hometown that will help your friend get around. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  7 \\n \\nWhat did you choose to draw on your map? Is your house or where you work on the map? What about \\nstreets, restaurants, malls, museums, or other points of interest? How did you draw objects on your map? \\nDid you use symbols, lines, and shapes? Are places labeled? Why did you choose to include certain places \\nand features on your map but not others? What limitations did you encounter when making your map?  \\nThis simple exercise is instructive for several reasons. First, it illustrates what you know about where you \\nlive. Your simple map is a rough approximation of your local geographic knowledge and mental map. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  8 \\nSecond, it highlights the way in which you relate to your local environment. What you choose to include \\nand exclude on your map provides insights about what places you think are important and how you move \\nthrough your place or residence. Third, if we were to compare your mental map to someone else\u2019s from \\nthe same place, certain similarities emerge that shed light upon how we as humans tend to think spatially \\nand organize geographical information in our minds. Fourth, this exercise reveals something about your \\nartistic, creative, and cartographic abilities. In this respect, not only are mental maps unique, but also the \\nway in which such maps are drawn or represented on the page is unique too.  \\nTo reinforce these points, consider the series of mental maps of Los Angeles provided in Figure 1.1 \\n\"Mental Map of Los Angeles A\". \\nFigure 1.1 Mental Map of Los Angeles A \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  9 \\nFigure 1.2 Mental Map of Los Angeles B \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  10 \\nFigure 1.3 Mental Map of Los Angeles C \\n \\nTake a moment to look at each map and compare the maps with the following questions in mind:  \\n\u2022 What similarities are there on each map? \\n\u2022 What are some of the differences? \\n\u2022 Which places or features are illustrated on the map? \\n\u2022 From what you know about Los Angeles, what is included or excluded on the maps? \\n\u2022 What assumptions are made in each map? \\n\u2022 At what scale is the map drawn? \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  11 \\nEach map is probably an imperfect representation of one\u2019s mental map, but we can see some similarities \\nand differences that provide insights into how people relate to Los Angeles, maps, and more generally, the \\nworld. First, all maps are oriented so that north is up. Though only one of the maps contains a north \\narrow that explicitly informs viewers the geographic orientation of the map, we are accustomed to most \\nmaps having north at the top of the page. Second, all but the first map identify some prominent features \\nand landmarks in the Los Angeles area. For instance, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) appears on \\ntwo of these maps, as do the Santa Monica Mountains. How the airport is represented or portrayed on the \\nmap, for instance, as text, an abbreviation, or symbol, also speaks to our experience using and \\nunderstanding maps. Third, two of the maps depict a portion of the freeway network in Los Angeles, and \\none also highlights the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek. In a city where the \u201ccar is king,\u201d how can any \\nmap omit the freeways? \\nWhat you include and omit on your map, by choice or not, speaks volumes about your geographical \\nknowledge and spatial awareness\u2014 or lack thereof. Recognizing and identifying what we do not know is an \\nimportant part of learning. It is only when we identify the unknown that we  are able to ask questions, \\ncollect information to answer those questions, develop knowledge through answers, and begin to \\nunderstand the world where we live. \\nAsking Geographic Questions \\nFilling in the gaps in our mental maps and, more generally, the gaps in our geographic knowledge requires \\nus to ask questions about the world where we live and how we relate to it. Such questions can be simple \\nwith a local focus (e.g., \u201cWhich way is the nearest hospital?\u201d) or more complex with a more global \\nperspective (e.g., \u201cHow is urbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world?\u201d). The thread \\nthat unifies such questions is geography. For instance, the question of \u201cwhere?\u201d is an essential part of the \\nquestions \u201cWhere is the nearest hospital?\u201d and \u201cWhere are the biodiversity hotspots in relation to cities?\u201d \\nBeing able to articulate questions clearly and to break them into manageable pieces are very valuable \\nskills when using and applying a geographic information system (GIS).  \\nThough there may be no such thing as a \u201cdumb\u201d question, some questions are indeed better than others. \\nLearning how to ask the right question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding the answer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  12 \\nitself. However, when we ask the right question, problems are more easily solved and our understanding \\nof the world is improved. There are five general types of geographic questions that we can ask and that \\nGIS can help us to answer. Each type of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples \\n(Nyerges 1991). [1] \\nQuestions about geographic location: \\n\u2022 Where is it? \\n\u2022 Why is it here or there? \\n\u2022 How much of it is here or there? \\nQuestions about geographic distribution: \\n\u2022 Is it distributed locally or globally? \\n\u2022 Is it spatially clustered or dispersed? \\n\u2022 Where are the boundaries? \\nQuestions about geographic association: \\n\u2022 What else is near it? \\n\u2022 What else occurs with it? \\n\u2022 What is absent in its presence? \\nQuestions about geographic interaction: \\n\u2022 Is it linked to something else? \\n\u2022 What is the nature of this association? \\n\u2022 How much interaction occurs between the locations? \\nQuestions about geographic change: \\n\u2022 Has it always been here? \\n\u2022 How has it changed over time and space? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  13 \\n\u2022 What causes its diffusion or contraction? \\nThese and related geographic questions are frequently asked by people from various areas of  expertise, \\nindustries, and professions. For instance, urban planners, traffic engineers, and demographers may be \\ninterested in understanding the commuting patterns between cities and suburbs (geographic interaction). \\nBiologists and botanists may be curious about why one animal or plant species flourishes in one place and \\nnot another (geographic location/distribution). Epidemiologists and public health officials are certainly \\ninterested in where disease outbreaks occur and how, why, and where they spread (g eographic \\nchange/interaction/location). \\nA GIS can assist in answering all these questions and many more. Furthermore, a GIS often opens up \\nadditional avenues of inquiry when searching for answers to geographic questions. Herein is one of the \\ngreatest strengths of the GIS. While a GIS can be used to answer specific questions or to solve particular \\nproblems, it often unearths even more interesting questions and presents more problems to be solved in \\nthe future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Mental maps are psychological tools that we use to understand, relate to, and navigate through the \\nenvironment in which we live, work, and play. \\n\u2022 Mental maps are unique to the individual. \\n\u2022 Learning how to ask geographic questions is important to using and applying GISs.  \\n\u2022 Geographic questions are concerned with location, distributions, associations, interactions, and change.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Draw a map of where you live. Discuss the similarities, differences, styles, and techniques on your map \\nand compare them with two others. What are the commonalities between the maps? What are the \\ndifferences? What accounts for such similarities and differences?  \\n2. Draw a map of the world and compare it to a world map in an atlas. What similarities and differences are \\nthere? What explains the discrepancies between your map and the atlas? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  14 \\n3. Provide two questions concerned with geographic location, distribution, association, interaction, and \\nchange about global warming, urbanization, biodiversity, economic development, and war.  \\n \\n[1] Nyerges, T. 1991. \u201cAnalytical Map Use.\u201d Cartography and Geographic Information Systems (formerly The \\nAmerican Cartographer) 18: 11\u201322. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  15 \\n1.2 Geographic Concepts \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to introduce and explain how the key concepts of location, direction, \\ndistance, space, and navigation are relevant to geography and geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nBefore we can learn \u201chow to do\u201d a geographic information system (GIS), it is first necessary to review \\nand reconsider a few key geographic concepts that are often taken for granted. For instance, what is a \\nlocation and how can it be defined? At what distance does a location become \u201cnearby\u201d? Or what do \\nwe mean when we say that someone has a \u201cgood sense of direction\u201d? By answering these and related \\nquestions, we establish a framework that will help us to learn and to apply a GIS. This framework \\nwill also permit us to share and communicate geographic information with others, which can \\nfacilitate collaboration, problem solving, and decision making. \\nLocation \\nThe one concept that distinguishes geography from other fields is location, which is central to a \\nGIS. Location is simply a position on the surface of the earth. What is more, nearly everything can be \\nassigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of something, we can a put it on a map, for \\nexample, with a GIS. \\nGenerally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or absolute terms. In the case of the \\nformer, locations are simply defined and described by name. For example, city names such as New York, \\nTokyo, or London refer to nominal locations. Toponymy, or the study of place names and their respective \\nhistory and meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations (Monmonier 1996, 2006).  [1], [2] Though \\nwe tend to associate the notion of location with particular points on the surface of the earth, locations can \\nalso refer to geographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g., Siberia). The United States \\nBoard on Geographic Names (http://geonames.usgs.gov) maintains geographic naming standards and \\nkeeps track of such names through the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS; \\nhttp://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic). The GNIS database also provides information about which \\nstate and county the feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  16 \\nContrasting nominal locations are absolute locations that use some type of reference system to define \\npositions on the earth\u2019s surface. For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth using latitude \\nand longitude is an example of absolute location. Postal codes and street addresses are other examples of \\nabsolute location that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there is no global standard when it \\ncomes to street addresses, we can determine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of \\nparticular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and other geographic data through a pr ocess \\ncalled geocoding. There are several free online geocoders (e.g., http://worldkit.org/geocoder) that return \\nthe latitude and longitude for various locations and addresses around the world.  \\nWith the advent of the global positioning system (GPS) (see alsohttp://www.gps.gov), determining the \\nlocation of nearly any object on the surface of the earth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. \\nGPS technology consists of a constellation of twenty-four satellites that are orbiting the earth and \\nconstantly transmitting time signals (see Figure 1.4 \"Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) \\nSatellites\"). To determine a position, earth-based GPS units (e.g., handheld devices, car navigation \\nsystems, mobile phones) receive the signals from at least three of these satellites and use this information \\nto triangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate system (GCS) to report location. \\nOriginally developed by the United States Department of Defense for military purposes, there are now a \\nwide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  17 \\nFigure 1.4 Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites \\n \\nLocation can also be defined in relative terms. Relative location refers to defining and describing places in \\nrelation to other known locations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg, South Africa; New \\nZealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul, Afghanistan, is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike \\nnominal or absolute locations that define single points, relative locations provide a bit more information \\nand situate one place in relation to another. \\nDirection \\nLike location, the concept of direction is central to geography and GISs. Direction refers to the position of \\nsomething relative to something else usually along a line. In order to determine direction, a reference \\npoint or benchmark from which direction will be measured needs to be established. One of the most \\ncommon benchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric direction refers to when we use \\nourselves as a directional benchmark. Describing something as \u201cto my left,\u201d \u201cbehind me,\u201d or \u201cnext to me\u201d \\nare examples of egocentric direction. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  18 \\nAs the name suggests, landmark direction uses a known landmark or geographic feature as a benchmark \\nto determine direction. Such landmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point of interest \\nlike the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature like a mountain range or river. The important thing to \\nremember about landmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that the landmark should be \\nrelatively well-known. \\nIn geography and GISs, there are three more standard benchmarks that are used  to define the directions \\nof true north, magnetic north, and grid north. True north is based on the point at which the axis of the \\nearth\u2019s rotation intersects the earth\u2019s surface. In this respect the North and South Poles serve as the \\ngeographic benchmarks for determining direction. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the \\nsurface of the earth where the earth\u2019s magnetic fields converge. This is also the point to which magnetic \\ncompasses point. Note that magnetic north falls somewhere in northern Canada and is not geographically \\ncoincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid north simply refers to the northward direction that the \\ngrid lines of latitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point to.  \\nFigure 1.5 The Three Norths: True, Magnetic, and Grid \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  19 \\nSource: http://kenai.fws.gov/overview/notebook/2004/sept/3sep2004.htm \\nDistance \\nComplementing the concepts of location and direction is distance. Distance refers to the degree or amount \\nof separation between locations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with various units. We \\ncan describe the distances between locations nominally as \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall,\u201d or we can describe two or \\nmore locations as \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar apart.\u201d Absolute distance is measured or calculated using a standard \\nmetric. The formula for the distance between two points on a planar (i.e., flat) surface is the following: \\nD=(x2\u2212x1)2+(y2\u2212y1)2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a \\nCalculating the distance between two locations on the surface of the earth, ho wever, is a bit more involved \\nbecause we are dealing with a three-dimensional object. Moving from the three-dimensional earth to two-\\ndimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile devices is not a trivial matter and is discussed \\nin greater detail in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". \\nWe also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the distance between London and \\nSingapore can be measured in miles, kilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship. \\nWhether or not such distances make London and Singapore \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar\u201d from each other is a matter of \\nopinion, experience, and patience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that derived from \\nthe distance formula, provide a standardized method to measure how far away o r how near locations are \\nfrom each other. \\nSpace \\nWhere distance suggests a measurable quantity in terms of how far apart locations are situated, space is a \\nmore abstract concept that is more commonly described rather than measured. For example, space can be  \\ndescribed as \u201cempty,\u201d \u201cpublic,\u201d or \u201cprivate.\u201d \\nWithin the scope of a GIS, we are interested in space, and in particular, we are interested in what fills \\nparticular spaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this sense,  space is a somewhat \\nambiguous and generic term that is used to denote the general geographic area of interest.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  20 \\nOne kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is topological space. Simply put, topological \\nspace is concerned with the nature of relationships and the connectivity of locations within a given space. \\nWhat is important within topological space are (1) how locations are (or are not) related or connected to \\neach other and (2) the rules that govern such geographic relationships.  \\nTransportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the best illustrations of topological \\nspaces (see Figure 1.6 \"Metro Map from London\" and Figure 1.7 \"Metro Map from Moscow\"). When using \\nsuch maps, we are primarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another along  a transportation \\nnetwork. Certain rules also govern how we can travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible \\nonly at a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular line). Such maps may be of little \\nuse when traveling around a city by car or foot, but they show the local transportation network and how \\nlocations are linked together in an effective and efficient manner.  \\nFigure 1.6 Metro Map from London \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  21 \\nFigure 1.7 Metro Map from Moscow \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  22 \\nNavigation \\nTransportation maps like those discussed previously illustrate how we move through the environments \\nwhere we live, work, and play. This movement and, in particular, destination-oriented travel are generally \\nreferred to as navigation. How we navigate through space is a complex pro cess that blends together our \\nvarious motor skills; technology; mental maps; and awareness of locations, distances, directions, and the \\nspace where we live (Golledge and Stimson 1997). [3] What is more, our geographical knowledge and \\nspatial awareness is continuously updated and changed as we move from one location to another.  \\nThe acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor. Though several factors influence the \\nnature of such knowledge, we tend to rely on the three following types of geograph ic knowledge when \\nnavigating through space: \\n1. Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and identify unique points, patterns, or features \\n(e.g., landmarks) in space. \\n2. Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between landmarks by moving throug h space. \\n3. Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks are in relation to each other and to take \\nshortcuts. \\nEach type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after the other. For instance, when we find \\nourselves in a new or an unfamiliar location, we usually identify a few unique points of interest (e.g., \\nhotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are in essence building up our landmark knowledge. \\nUsing and traveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge and rei nforces our landmark \\nknowledge and our overall geographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin to \\nunderstand how routes connect landmarks together and how various locations are situated in space. It is \\nat this point, when we are somewhat comfortable with our survey knowledge, that we are able to take \\nshortcuts from one location to another. Though there is no guarantee that a shortcut will be successful, if \\nwe get lost, we are at least expanding our local geographic knowledge.  \\nLandmark, route, and survey knowledge are the cornerstones of having a sense of direction and frame our \\ngeographical learning and awareness. While some would argue that they are born with a good sense of \\ndirection, others admit to always getting lost. The popularity of personal navigation devices and online Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  23 \\nmapping services speaks to the overwhelming desire to know and to situate where we are in the world. \\nThough developing and maintaining a keen sense of direction presumably matters less and less as such \\ndevices and services continue to develop and spread, it can also be argued that the more we know about \\nwhere we are in the world, the more we will want to learn about it.  \\nThis section covers concepts essential to geography, GISs, and many other fields of interest. \\nUnderstanding how location, direction, and distance can be defined and described provides an important \\nfoundation for the successful use and implementation of a GIS. Thinking about space and how we \\nnavigate through it also serves to improve and own geographic knowledge and spatial awareness. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Location refers to the position of an object on the surface of the earth and is commonly expressed in \\nterms of latitude and longitude. \\n\u2022 Direction is always determined relative to a benchmark. \\n\u2022 Distance refers to the separation between locations. \\n\u2022 Navigation is the destination-oriented movement through space. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Find your hometown in the GNIS and see what other features share this name. Explore the toponymy of \\nyour hometown online. \\n2. How are GPSs and related navigation technology influencing how we learn about our local environments?  \\n3.

The objective of this section is to define and describe how a geographic information system (GIS) is \\napplied, its development, and its future. \\nUp to this point, the primary concern of this chapter was to introduce concepts essential to \\ngeography that are also relevant to geographic information systems (GISs). Furthermore, the \\nintroduction of these concepts was prefaced by an overview of how we think spatially and the nature \\nof geographic inquiry. This final section is concerned with defining a GIS, describing its use, and \\nexploring its future. \\nGIS Defined \\nSo what exactly is a GIS? Is it computer software? Is it a collection of computer hardware? I s it a service \\nthat is distributed and accessed via the Internet? Is it a tool? Is it a system? Is it a science? The answer to \\nall these questions is, \u201cGIS is all of the above\u2014 and more.\u201d \\nFrom a software perspective, a GIS consists of a special type of computer program capable of storing, \\nediting, processing, and presenting geographic data and information as maps. There are several GIS \\nsoftware providers, such as Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. ( http://www.esri.com), which \\ndistributes ArcGIS, and PitneyBowes (http://www.pbinsight.com), which distributes MapInfo GIS. \\nThough online mapping services and interfaces are provided by companies like Google, Yahoo!, and \\nMicrosoft, such services are not (yet) considered fully fledged GIS platforms. There are also open -source \\nGIS options, such as GRASS (http://grass.itc.it), which is freely distributed and maintained by the open-\\nsource community. All GIS software, regardless of vendor, consists of a database management system that \\nis capable of handling and integrating two types of data: spatial data and attribute data.  \\nSpatial data refer to the real-world geographic objects of interest, such as streets, buildings, lakes, and \\ncountries, and their respective locations. In addition to location, each of these objects also possesses \\ncertain traits of interest, or attributes, such as a name, number of stories, depth, or population. GIS \\nsoftware keeps track of both the spatial and attribute data and permits us to link the two types of data \\ntogether to create information and facilitate analysis. One popular way to describe and to visualize a GIS Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  25 \\nis picturing it as a cake with many layers. Each layer of the cake represents a different geographic theme, \\nsuch as water features, buildings, and roads, and each layer is stacked one on top of another (see  Figure \\n1.8 \"A GIS as a Layered Cake\"). \\nFigure 1.8 A GIS as a Layered Cake \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  26 \\nAs hardware, a GIS consists of a computer, memory, storage devices, scanners, printers, global \\npositioning system (GPS) units, and other physical components. If the computer is situated on a network, \\nthe network can also be considered an integral component of the GIS because it enables us to share data \\nand information that the GIS uses as inputs and creates as outputs.  \\nAs a tool, a GIS permits us to maintain, analyze, and share a wealth of data and information. From the \\nrelatively simple task of mapping the path of a hurricane to the more c omplex task of determining the \\nmost efficient garbage collection routes in a city, a GIS is used across the public and private sectors. \\nOnline and mobile mapping, navigation, and location-based services are also personalizing and \\ndemocratizing GISs by bringing maps and mapping to the masses. \\nThese are just a few definitions of a GIS. Like several of the geographic concepts discussed previously, \\nthere is no single or universally accepted definition of a GIS. There are probably just as many definitions \\nof GISs as there are people who use GISs. In this regard, it is the people like you who are learning, \\napplying, developing, and studying GISs in new and compelling ways that unifies it.  \\nThree Approaches to GISs \\nIn addition to recognizing the many definitions of a GIS, it is also constructive to identify three general \\nand overlapping approaches to understanding GISs\u2014 the application approach, the developer approach, \\nand the science approach. Though most GIS users would probably identify with one approach more than \\nanother, they are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, as GISs and, more generally, information technology \\nadvance, the following categories will be transformed and reshaped accordingly.  \\nThe application approach to GISs considers a GIS primarily to be a tool.  This is also perhaps the most \\ncommon view of a GIS. From this perspective, a GIS is used to answer questions, support decision \\nmaking, maintain an inventory of geographic data and information, and, of course, make maps. As a tool, \\nthere are arguably certain skills that should be acquired and required in order to use and apply a GIS \\nproperly. The application approach to a GIS is more concerned with using and applying GISs to solve \\nproblems than the GIS itself. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  27 \\nFor instance, suppose we want to determine the best location for a new supermarket. What factors are \\nimportant behind making this decision? Information about neighborhood demographics, existing \\nsupermarkets, the location of suppliers, zoning regulations, and available real estate are all critical to th is \\ndecision. A GIS platform can integrate such information that is obtained from the census bureau, realtors, \\nthe local zoning agency, and even the Internet. A suitability analysis can then be carried out with the GIS, \\nthe output of which will show the best locations for the supermarket given the various local geographic \\nopportunities (e.g., demographics/consumers) and constraints (e.g., supply chain, zoning, and real estate \\nlimitations) that exist. \\nThere are several professional communities and organizations concerned with the use and application of a \\nGIS, such as the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association ( http://urisa.org) and the Global \\nSpatial Data Infrastructure Association (http://www.gsdi.org). \\nUnlike the previous example in which a GIS is applied to answer or solve a particular question, the \\ndeveloper approach to GISs is concerned with the development of the GIS as a software or technology \\nplatform. Rather than focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned \\nwith improving, refining, and extending the tool and technology itself and is largely in the realm of \\ncomputer programmers and software developers. \\nThe ongoing integration and evolution of GISs, maps, the Internet, and web-based mapping can be \\nconsidered an outcome of the developer approach to GISs. In this regard, delivering maps, navigation \\ntools, and user-friendly GISs to people via the Internet is the central challenge at hand. The underlying, \\nand to a large extent hidden, logic and computer code that permit us to ask questions about how to get \\nfrom point A to point B on a navigation website or to see where a new restaurant or open house is located \\non a web-based map are for the most part the domain of GIS programmers and developers. The Open \\nSource Geospatial Foundation (http://www.osgeo.org) is another example of a community of GIS \\ndevelopers working to build and distribute open-source GIS software. \\nIt is the developer approach to GISs that drives and introduces innovation and is informed and guided by \\nthe existing needs and future demands of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting \\nedge, it is dynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  28 \\nThe science approach to GISs not only dovetails with the applications and developer approaches but also \\nis more concerned with broader questions and how geography, cognition, m ap interpretation, and other \\ngeospatial issues such as accuracy and errors are relevant to GISs and vice versa (see Longley et al. \\n2005). [1] This particular approach is often referred to as geographic information science (GIScience), and \\nit is also interested in the social consequences and implications of the use and diffusion of GIS technology. \\nFrom exploring the propagation of error to examining how privacy is being redefined by GISs and related \\ntechnology, GIScience is at the same time an agent of change as well as one of understanding. \\nIn light of the rapid rate of technological and GIS innovation, in conjunction with the widespread \\napplication of GISs, new questions about GIS technology and its use are continually emerging. One of the \\nmost discussed topics concerns privacy, and in particular, what is referred to as locational privacy. In \\nother words, who has the right to view or determine your geographic location at any given time? Your \\nparents? Your school? Your employer? Your cell phone carrier? The government or police? When are you \\nwilling to divulge your location? Is there a time or place where you prefer to be \u201coff the grid\u201d or not \\nlocatable? Such questions concerning locational privacy were of relatively little concern a few years ago. \\nHowever, with the advent of GPS and its integration into cars and other mobile devices, questions, \\ndebates, and even lawsuits concerning locational privacy and who has the right to such information are \\nrapidly emerging. \\nAs the name suggests, the developer approach to GISs is concerned with the development of GISs. Rather \\nthan focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned with improving, \\nrefining, and extending the tool itself and is largely in the realm of computer programmers an d software \\ndevelopers. For instance, the advent of web-based mapping is an outcome of the developer approach to \\nGISs. In this regard, the challenge was how to bring GISs to people via the Internet and not necessarily \\nhow people would use web-based GISs. The developer approach to GISs drives and introduces innovation \\nand is guided by the needs of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting edge, it is \\ndynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  \\nGIS Futures Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  29 \\nThe definitions and approaches to GISs described previously illustrate the scope and breadth of this \\nspecial type of information technology. Furthermore, as GISs become more accessible and widely \\ndistributed, there will always be new questions to be answered, new applications to be developed, and \\ninnovative technologies to integrate. \\nOne notable development is the emergence of what is called the geospatial web. The geospatial web or \\ngeoweb refers to the integration of the vast amounts of content available on t he Internet (e.g., text, \\nphotographs, video, and music) with geographic information, such as location. Adding such geographic \\ninformation to such content is called geotagging and is similar to geocoding. The integration of geographic \\ninformation with such content opens up new ways to access, search, organize, share, and distribute \\ninformation. \\nMapping mashups, or web-based applications that combine data and information from one source and \\nmap it with online mapping applications, are an example of the geoweb  at work. There are mashups for \\nnearly everything that can be assigned a location, from restaurants and music festivals to your \\nphotographs and favorite hikes. Several examples of such mapping mashups can be found on the Internet \\nat sites such as http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com. \\nThough the geoweb may not necessarily be considered a GIS, it certainly draws upon the same concepts \\nand ideas of geography and may someday encompass GISs. Perhaps more important, the diffusion of GISs \\nand the emergence of the geoweb have increased geographic awareness by lowering the barriers of \\nviewing, using, and even creating maps and related geographic data and information. Though there are \\nseveral benefits to this democratization of GISs, and more generally information and technology, it should \\nalso be recognized that there are also consequences and implications.  \\nAs with any other technology, great care must be taken in the use and application of GISs. For instance, \\nwhen was the last time you questioned what appeared on a map? For better or worse, maps are among the \\nmost authoritative forms of information and are the subject of Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". As tomorrow\u2019s \\nGIS practitioners, you will have the ability to influence greatly how decisions are made and how others \\nview and relate to the world with the maps that you create in a GIS environment. What and how you Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  30 \\nchoose to map is therefore a nontrivial exercise. Becoming more aware of our biases, limitations, and \\npreferences permits us to take full advantage of geographic information systems with confidence.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 There is no single or universal definition of a GIS; it is defined and used in many different ways.  \\n\u2022 One of the key features of a GIS is that it integrates spatial data with attribute data. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Explore the web for mapping mashups that match your personal interests. How can they be improved?  \\n2. Create your own mapping mashup with a free online mapping service. \\n \\n[1] Longley, P., M.

Therefore, in order \\nfor us to become proficient with GISs, we need to learn more about cartography, maps, and mapping. \\nThe first part of this chapter defines what a map is and describes a few key map types. Next, \\ncartographic or mapping conventions are discussed with particular emphasis placed upon map scale, \\ncoordinate systems, and map projections. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the process of \\nmap abstraction as it relates to GISs. This chapter provides the foundations for working with, \\nintegrating, and making maps with GISs. \\n \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  32 \\n2.1 Maps and Map Types \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to define what a map is and to describe reference, thematic, and dynamic \\nmaps. \\nMaps are among the most compelling forms of information for several reasons. Maps are artistic. Maps \\nare scientific. Maps preserve history. Maps clarify. Maps reveal the invisible. Maps inform the future. \\nRegardless of the reason, maps capture the imagination of people around the world. As one of the most \\ntrusted forms of information, map makers and geographic information system (GIS) practitioners hold a \\nconsiderable amount of power and influence (Wood 1992; Monmonier 1996).  [1], [2] Therefore, \\nunderstanding and appreciating maps and how maps convey information are important aspects of GISs. \\nThe appreciation of maps begins with exploring various map types.  \\nSo what exactly is a map? Like GISs, there are probably just as many definitions of maps as there are \\npeople who use and make them (see Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998). [3] For starters, we can define a map \\nsimply as a representation of the world. Such maps can be stored in our brain (i.e., mental maps), they can \\nbe printed on paper, or they can appear online. Notwithstanding the actual medium of the map (e.g., our \\nfleeting thoughts, paper, or digital display), maps represent and describe various aspects of the world. For \\npurposes of clarity, the three types of maps are the reference map, the thematic map, and the dynamic \\nmap. \\nReference Maps \\nThe primary purpose of a reference map is to deliver location information to the map user. Geographic \\nfeatures and map elements on a reference map tend to be treated and represented equally. In other words, \\nno single aspect of a reference map takes precedent over any other aspect. Moreover, reference maps \\ngenerally represent geographic reality accurately. Examples of some common types of reference maps \\ninclude topographic maps such as those created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS; \\nseehttp://topomaps.usgs.gov) and image maps obtained from satellites or aircraft that are available \\nthrough online mapping services. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  33 \\nFigure 2.1 USGS Topographic Map of Boulder, CO \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  34 \\nFigure 2.2 Image Map of Palm Island, Dubai, from NASA \\n \\nThe accuracy of a given reference map is indeed critical to many users. For instance, local governments \\nneed accurate reference maps for land use, zoning, and tax purposes. National governments need accurate \\nreference maps for political, infrastructure, and military purposes. People who depend on navigation \\ndevices like global positioning system (GPS) units also need accurate and up -to-date reference maps in \\norder to arrive at their desired destinations. \\nThematic Maps \\nContrasting the reference map are thematic maps. As the name suggests, thematic  maps are concerned \\nwith a particular theme or topic of interest. While reference maps emphasize the location of geographic \\nfeatures, thematic maps are more concerned with how things are distributed across space . Such things are \\noften abstract concepts such as life expectancy around the world, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \\nin Europe, or literacy rates across India. One of the strengths of mapping, and in particular of thematic \\nmapping, is that it can make such abstract and invisible concepts visible and comparable on a map.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  35 \\nFigure 2.3 World Life Expectancies \\n \\nFigure 2.4 European GDP \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  36 \\nFigure 2.5 Indian Literacy Rates \\n \\nIt is important to note that reference and thematic maps are not mutually exclusive. In other words, \\nthematic maps often contain and combine geographical reference information, and conversely, reference \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  37 \\nmaps may contain thematic information. What is more, when used in conjunction, thematic and reference \\nmaps often complement each other. \\nFor example, public health officials in a city may be interested in providing equal access to emergency \\nrooms to the city\u2019s residents. Insights into this and related questions can be obtained through visual \\ncomparisons of a reference map that shows the locations of emergency rooms across the city to thematic \\nmaps of various segments of the population (e.g., households below poverty, percent elderly, \\nunderrepresented groups). \\nWithin the context of a GIS, we can overlay the reference map of emergency rooms directly on top of the \\npopulation maps to see whether or not access is uniform across neighborhood types. Clearly, there are \\nother factors to consider when looking at emergency room access (e.g., access to transport), but through \\nsuch map overlays, underserved neighborhoods can be identified. \\nFigure 2.6 Map Overlay Process \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  38 \\nWhen presented in hardcopy format, both reference and thematic maps are static or fixed representations \\nof reality. Such permanence on the page suggests that geography and the things that we map are also in \\nmany ways fixed or constant. This is far from reality. The integration of GISs with other forms of \\ninformation technology like the Internet and mobile telecommunications is rapidly changing this view of \\nmaps and mapping, as well as geography at large. \\nDynamic Maps \\nThe diffusion of GISs and the popularity of online mapping tools and applications speak to this shift in \\nthinking about maps and map use. In this regard, it is worthwhile to discuss the diffusion of dynamic \\nmaps. Dynamic maps are simply changeable or interactive representations of the earth. Dynamic mapping \\nrefers more to how maps are used and delivered to the map user today (e.g., online, via mobile phone) \\nthan to the content of the map itself. Both reference and thematic maps can be dynamic in nature, and \\nsuch maps are an integral component to any GIS. The key point about dynamic maps is that more and \\nmore people, not just GIS professionals, have access to such maps. \\nUnlike a hardcopy map that has features and elements users cannot modify or change, dynamic maps \\nencourage and sometimes require user interaction. Such interaction can include changing the scale or \\nvisible area by zooming in or zooming out, selecting which features or layers to include or to remove from \\na map (e.g., roads, imagery), or even starting and stopping a map animation.  \\nFigure 2.7 Google Maps on an iPhone \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  39 \\nFigure 2.8 Polar Ice Cap \\n \\nTo see the animation, go to http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?3464. \\nJust as dynamic maps will continue to evolve and require more user interaction in the future, map users \\nwill demand more interactive map features and controls. As this democratization of maps and mapping \\ncontinues, the geographic awareness and map appreciation of map users will also increase. Therefore, it is \\nof critical importance to understand the nature, form, and content of maps to support the changing needs , \\ndemands, and expectations of map users in the future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The main purpose of a reference map is to show the location of geographical objects of interest.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  40 \\n\u2022 Thematic maps are concerned with showing how one or more geographical aspects are distributed across \\nspace. \\n\u2022 Dynamic maps refer to maps that are changeable and often require user interaction.  \\n\u2022 The democratization of maps and mapping is increasing access, use, and appreciation for all types of \\nmaps, as well as driving map innovations. \\n \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to describe and discuss the concepts of map scale, coordinate systems, and \\nmap projections and explain why they are central to maps, mapping, and geographic information systems \\n(GISs). \\nAll map users and map viewers have certain expectations about what is contained on a map. Such \\nexpectations are formed and learned from previous experience by working with maps. It is important \\nto note that such expectations also change with increased exposure to maps. Understanding and \\nmeeting the expectations of map viewers is a challenging but necessary task because such \\nexpectations provide a starting point for the creation of any map. \\nThe central purpose of a map is to provide relevant and useful information to the map user. In order \\nfor a map to be of value, it must convey information effectively and efficiently. Mapping conventions \\nfacilitate the delivery of information in such a manner by recognizing and managing the expectations \\nof map users. Generally speaking, mapping or cartographic conventions refer to the accepted rules, \\nnorms, and practices behind the making of maps. One of the most recognized mapping conventions \\nis that \u201cnorth is up\u201d on most maps. Though this may not always be the case, many map users expect \\nnorth to be oriented or to coincide with the top edge of a map or viewing device like a computer \\nmonitor. \\nSeveral other formal and informal mapping conventions and characteristics, many of which are \\ntaken for granted, can be identified. Among the most important cartographic considerations are map \\nscale, coordinate systems, and map projections. Map scale is concerned with reducing geographical \\nfeatures of interest to manageable proportions, coordinate systems help us define the positions of \\nfeatures on the surface of the earth, and map projections are concerned with moving from the three-\\ndimensional world to the two dimensions of a flat map or display, all of which are discussed in \\ngreater detail in this chapter. \\nMap Scale Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  42 \\nThe world is a big place\u2026really big. One of the challenges behind mapping the world and its resident \\nfeatures, patterns, and processes is reducing it to a manageable size. What exactly is meant by \\n\u201cmanageable\u201d is open to discussion and largely depends on the purpose and needs of the map at hand. \\nNonetheless, all maps reduce or shrink the world and its geographic features of interest by some \\nfactor. Map scale refers to the factor of reduction of the world so it fits on a map.  \\nMap scale can be represented by text, a graphic, or some combination of the two. For example, it is \\ncommon to see \u201cone inch represents one kilometer\u201d or something similar written on a map to give map \\nusers an idea of the scale of the map. Map scale can also be portrayed graphically with what is called a \\nscale bar. Scale bars are usually used on reference maps and allow map users to approximate distances \\nbetween locations and features on a map, as well as to get an overall idea of the scale of the map.  \\nFigure 2.9 Map Scale from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Map \\n \\nThe representative fraction (RF) describes scale as a simple ratio. The numerator, which is always set to \\none (i.e., 1), denotes map distance and the denominator denotes ground or \u201creal-world\u201d distance. One of \\nthe benefits of using a representative fraction to describe scale is that it is unit neutral. In other words, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  43 \\nany unit of measure can be used to interpret the map scale. Consider a map with an RF of 1:10,000. This \\nmeans that one unit on the map represents 10,000 units on the ground. Such units could be inches, \\ncentimeters, or even pencil lengths; it really does not matter. \\nMap scales can also be described as either \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge.\u201d Such descriptions are usually made in \\nreference to representative fractions and the amount of detail represented on a map. For instance, a map \\nwith an RF of 1:1,000 is considered a large-scale map when compared to a map with an RF of 1:1,000,000 \\n(i.e., 1:1,000 > 1:1,000,000). Furthermore, while the large-scale map shows more detail and less area, the \\nsmall-scale map shows more area but less detail. Clearly, determining the thresholds for small - or large-\\nscale maps is largely a judgment call. \\nAll maps possess a scale, whether it is formally expressed or not. Though some say that online maps and \\nGISs are \u201cscaleless\u201d because we can zoom in and out at will, it is probably more accurate to say that GISs \\nand related mapping technology are multiscalar. Understanding map scale and its overall impact on h ow \\nthe earth and its features are represented is a critical part of both map making and GISs.  \\nCoordinate Systems \\nJust as all maps have a map scale, all maps have locations, too. Coordinate  systems are frameworks that \\nare used to define unique positions. For instance, in geometry we use x (horizontal) and y (vertical) \\ncoordinates to define points on a two-dimensional plane. The coordinate system that is most commonly \\nused to define locations on the three-dimensional earth is called the geographic coordinate system (GCS), \\nand it is based on a sphere or spheroid. A spheroid (a.k.a. ellipsoid  is simply a sphere that is slightly wider \\nthan it is tall and approximates more closely the true shape of the earth. Spheres are commonly used as \\nmodels of the earth for simplicity. \\nThe unit of measure in the GCS is degrees, and locations are defined by their respective latitude and \\nlongitude within the GCS. Latitude is measured relative to the equator at zero degrees, with maxima of \\neither ninety degrees north at the North Pole or ninety degrees south at the South Pole. Longitude is \\nmeasured relative to the prime meridian at zero degrees, with maxima of 180 degrees west or 180 degrees \\neast. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  44 \\nNote that latitude and longitude can be expressed in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) or in decimal \\ndegrees (DD). When using decimal degrees, latitudes above the equator and longitudes east of the prime \\nmeridian are positive, and latitudes below the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian are \\nnegative (see the following table for examples). \\n \\nNominal location Absolute location (DMS) Absolute location (DD) \\nLos Angeles, US 34\u00b0 3\u2032 North, 118\u00b0 15\u2032 West +34.05, \u2013118.25 \\nMumbai, India 18\u00b0 58\u2032 North, 72\u00b0 49\u2032 East +18.975, +72.8258 \\nSydney, Australia 33\u00b0 51\u2032 South, 151\u00b0 12\u2032 East \u201333.859, 151.211 \\nSao Paolo, Brazil 23\u00b0 33\u2032 South, 46\u00b0 38\u2032 West \u201323.550, \u201346.634 \\nConverting from DMS to DD is a relatively straightforward exercise. For example, since there are sixty \\nminutes in one degree, we can convert 118\u00b0 15 minutes to 118.25 (118 + 15/60). Note that an online search \\nof the term \u201ccoordinate conversion\u201d will return several coordinate conversion tools. \\nWhen we want to map things like mountains, rivers, streets, and buildings, we need to define how the \\nlines of latitude and longitude will be oriented and positioned on the sphere. A datum serves this purpose \\nand specifies exactly the orientation and origins of the lines of latitude and longitude relative to the center \\nof the earth or spheroid. \\nDepending on the need, situation, and location, there are several datums to choose from. For instance, \\nlocal datums try to match closely the spheroid to the earth\u2019s surface in a local area and return accurate \\nlocal coordinates. A common local datum used in the United States is  called NAD83 (i.e., North American \\nDatum of 1983). For locations in the United States and Canada, NAD83 returns relatively accurate \\npositions, but positional accuracy deteriorates when outside of North America.  \\nThe global WGS84 datum (i.e., World Geodetic System of 1984) uses the center of the earth as the origin \\nof the GCS and is used for defining locations across the globe. Because the datum uses the center of the \\nearth as its origin, locational measurements tend to be more consistent regardless where th ey are \\nobtained on the earth, though they may be less accurate than those returned by a local datum. Note that \\nswitching between datums will alter the coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) for all locations of \\ninterest. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  45 \\nMap Projections \\nPreviously we noted that the earth is really big. Not only is it big, but it is a big round spherical shape \\ncalled a spheroid. A globe is a very common and very good representation of the three- dimensional, \\nspheroid earth. One of the problems with globes, however, is that they are not very portable (i.e., you \\ncannot fold a globe and put in it in your pocket), and their small scale makes them of limited practical use \\n(i.e., geographic detail is sacrificed). To overcome these issues, it is necessary to transform the three -\\ndimensional shape of the earth to a two-dimensional surface like a flat piece of paper, computer screen, or \\nmobile device display in order to obtain more useful map forms and map scales. Enter the map projection.  \\nMap projections refer to the methods and procedures that are used to transform the spherical three-\\ndimensional earth into two-dimensional planar surfaces. Specifically, map projections are mathematical \\nformulas that are used to translate latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth to  x and y \\ncoordinates on a plane. Since there are an infinite number of ways this translation can be performed, \\nthere are an infinite number of map projections. The mathematics behind map projections are beyond the \\nscope of this introductory overview (but see Robinson et al. 1995; Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998), [1] and \\nfor simplicity, the following discussion focuses on describing types of map projections, the distortions \\ninherent to map projections, and the selection of appropriate map projections.  \\nTo illustrate the concept of a map projection, imagine that we place a light bulb in the center of a \\ntranslucent globe. On the globe are outlines of the continents and the lines of longitude and latitude called \\nthe graticule. When we turn the light bulb on, the outline of the continents and the graticule will be \\n\u201cprojected\u201d as shadows on the wall, ceiling, or any other nearby surface. This is what is meant by map \\n\u201cprojection.\u201d \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  46 \\nFigure 2.10 The Concept of Map \u201cProjection\u201d \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps and mapping, there are three surfaces used for map projections (i.e., surfaces \\non which we project the shadows of the graticule). These surfaces are the plane, the cylinder, and the \\ncone. Referring again to the previous example of a light bulb in the center of a globe, note that during the \\nprojection process, we can situate each surface in any number of ways. For example, surfaces can be \\ntangential to the globe along the equator or poles, they can pass through or intersect the surfa ce, and they \\ncan be oriented at any number of angles. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  47 \\nFigure 2.11 Map Projection Surfaces \\n \\nIn fact, naming conventions for many map projections include the surface as well as its orientation. For \\nexample, as the name suggests, \u201cplanar\u201d projections use the plane, \u201ccylindrical\u201d projections use cylinders, \\nand \u201cconic\u201d projections use the cone. For cylindrical projections, the \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d aspect refers \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  48 \\nto when the cylinder is tangential to the equator (i.e., the axis of the cylinder is oriented north \u2013south). \\nWhen the axis of the cylinder is perfectly oriented east\u2013west, the aspect is called \u201ctransverse,\u201d and all \\nother orientations are referred to as \u201coblique.\u201d Regardless the orientation or the surface on which a \\nprojection is based, a number of distortions will be introduced that will influence the choice of map \\nprojection. \\nWhen moving from the three-dimensional surface of the earth to a two-dimensional plane, distortions are \\nnot only introduced but also inevitable. Generally, map projections introduce  distortions in distance, \\nangles, and areas. Depending on the purpose of the map, a series of trade -offs will need to be made with \\nrespect to such distortions. \\nMap projections that accurately represent distances are referred to as equidistant projections. Note that \\ndistances are only correct in one direction, usually running north\u2013south, and are not correct everywhere \\nacross the map. Equidistant maps are frequently used for small-scale maps that cover large areas because \\nthey do a good job of preserving the shape of geographic features such as continents. \\nMaps that represent angles between locations, also referred to as bearings, are called conformal. \\nConformal map projections are used for navigational purposes due to the importance of maintaining a \\nbearing or heading when traveling great distances. The cost of preserving bearings is that areas tend to be \\nquite distorted in conformal map projections. Though shapes are more or less preserved over small areas, \\nat small scales areas become wildly distorted. The Mercator projection is an example of a conformal \\nprojection and is famous for distorting Greenland. \\nAs the name indicates, equal area or equivalent projections preserve the quality of area. Such projections \\nare of particular use when accurate measures or comparisons of geographical distributions are necessary \\n(e.g., deforestation, wetlands). In an effort to maintain true proportions in the surface of the earth, \\nfeatures sometimes become compressed or stretched depending on the orientation of the projection.  \\nMoreover, such projections distort distances as well as angular relationships.  \\nAs noted earlier, there are theoretically an infinite number of map projections to choose from. One of the \\nkey considerations behind the choice of map projection is to reduce the amount of distortion. The \\ngeographical object being mapped and the respective scale at which the map will be constructed are also Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  49 \\nimportant factors to think about. For instance, maps of the North and South Poles usually use planar or \\nazimuthal projections, and conical projections are best suited for the middle latitude areas of the earth. \\nFeatures that stretch east\u2013west, such as the country of Russia, are represented well with the standard \\ncylindrical projection, while countries oriented north\u2013south (e.g., Chile, Norway) are better represented \\nusing a transverse projection. \\nIf a map projection is unknown, sometimes it can be identified by working backward and examining \\nclosely the nature and orientation of the graticule (i.e., grid of latitude and longitu de), as well as the \\nvarying degrees of distortion. Clearly, there are trade-offs made with regard to distortion on every map. \\nThere are no hard-and-fast rules as to which distortions are more preferred over others. Therefore, the \\nselection of map projection largely depends on the purpose of the map. \\nWithin the scope of GISs, knowing and understanding map projections are critical. For instance, in order \\nto perform an overlay analysis like the one described earlier, all map layers need to be in the same \\nprojection. If they are not, geographical features will not be aligned properly, and any analyses performed \\nwill be inaccurate and incorrect. Most GISs include functions to assist in the identification of map \\nprojections, as well as to transform between projections in order to synchronize spatial data. Despite the \\ncapabilities of technology, an awareness of the potential and pitfalls that surround map projections is \\nessential. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map scale refers to the factor by which the real world is reduced to fit on a map.  \\n\u2022 A GIS is multiscalar. \\n\u2022 Map projections are mathematical formulas used to transform the three -dimensional earth to two \\ndimensions (e.g., paper maps, computer monitors). \\n\u2022 Map projections introduce distortions in distance, direction, and area.  \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the decision-making process behind maps and to underscore \\nthe need to be explicit and consistent when mapping and using geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nAs previously discussed, maps are a representation of the earth. Central to this representation is the \\nreduction of the earth and its features of interest to a manageable size (i.e., map scale) and its \\ntransformation into a useful two-dimensional form (i.e., map projection). The choice of both map \\nscale and, to a lesser extent, map projection will influence the content and shape of the map. \\nIn addition to the seemingly objective decisions made behind the choices of map scale and map \\nprojection are those concerning what to include and what to omit from the map. The purpose of a \\nmap will certainly guide some of these decisions, but other choices may be based on factors such as \\nspace limitations, map complexity, and desired accuracy. Furthermore, decisions about how to \\nclassify, simplify, or exaggerate features and how to symbolize objects of interest simultaneously fall \\nunder the realms of art and science (Slocum et al. 2004). [1] \\nThe process of moving from the \u201creal world\u201d to the world of maps is referred to as map abstraction. \\nThis process not only involves making choices about how to represent features but also, more \\nimportant with regard to geographic information systems (GISs), requires us to be explicit, \\nconsistent, and precise in terms of defining and describing geographical features of interest. Failure \\nto be explicit, consistent, and precise will return incorrect; inconsistent; and error-prone maps, \\nanalyses, and decisions based on such maps and GISs. This final section discusses map abstraction in \\nterms of geographical features and their respective graphical representation. \\nWhat Is a Forest? \\nOne of the most pressing environmental issues facing the world is deforestation. Generally, deforestation \\nrefers to the reduction of forest area. This is an important issue because it has possible implications for \\nclimate change, global warming, biodiversity, and the water balance of the earth, among other things. In \\nthe last century, deforestation has increased at an alarming rate and is mostly attributed to human Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  52 \\nactivity. Mapping forests regularly with a GIS is a logical way to monitor deforestation and has the \\npotential to inform policies regarding forest conservation efforts. Easy enough, so let\u2019s get started. \\nSo what exactly is a forest? How do we know where a forest begins and where it ends? How can naturally \\ncaused forest fires be differentiated from those started by humans? Can a forest exist in a swamp or \\nwetland? For that matter, what is the difference between a swamp and wetland? Such questions are  not \\ntrivial in the context of mapping and GISs. In fact, consistent and precise definitions of features like \\nforests or swamps increase the reliability and efficiency of maps, mapping, and analysis with GISs.  \\nFigure 2.12 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2001 \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  53 \\nFigure 2.13 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2009 \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps, cartography, and GISs, the world is made up of various features or entities. \\nSuch entities include but are not restricted to fire hydrants, caves, roads, rivers, lakes, hills, va lleys, \\noceans, and the occasional barn. Moreover, such features have a form, and more precisely, a geometric \\nform. For instance, fire hydrants and geysers are considered point-like features; rivers and streams are \\nlinear features; and lakes, countries, and forests are areal features. \\nFeatures can also be categorized as either discrete or continuous. Discrete  features are well defined and \\nare easy to locate, measure, and count, and their edges or boundaries are readily defined. Examples of \\ndiscrete features in a city include buildings, roads, traffic signals, and parks. Continuous  features, on the \\nother hand, are less well defined and exist across space. The most commonly cited examples of continuous \\nfeatures are temperature and elevation. Changes in both temperature and elevation tend to be gradual \\nover relatively large areas. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  54 \\nGeographical features also have several characteristics, traits, or attributes that may or may not be of \\ninterest. For instance, to continue the deforestation example, determining wheth er a forest is a rainforest \\nor whether a forest is in a protected park may be important. More general attributes may include \\nmeasurements such as tree density per acre, average canopy height in meters, or proportions like percent \\npalm trees or invasive species per hectare in the forest. \\nNotwithstanding the purpose of the map or GIS project at hand, it is critical that definitions of features \\nare clear and remain consistent. Similarly, it is important that the attributes of features are also \\nconsistently defined, measured, and reported in order to generate accurate and effective maps in an \\nefficient manner. Defining features and attributes of interest is often an iterative process of trial and error. \\nBeing able to associate a feature with a particular geometric form and to determine the fea ture type are \\ncentral to map abstraction, facilitate mapping, and the application of GISs.  \\nMap Content and Generalization \\nThe shape and content of maps vary according to purpose, need, and resources, among other factors. \\nWhat is common to most maps, and in particular to those within a GIS, is that they are graphical \\nrepresentations of reality. Put another way, various graphical symbols are used to represent geographical \\nfeatures or entities. Annotation or text is also commonly used on maps and facilitates m ap interpretation. \\nLearning about map content and map generalization is important because they serve as the building \\nblocks for spatial data that are used within a GIS. \\nBuilding upon the previous discussion about the geometric form of geographic features, maps typically \\nrely on three geometric objects: the point, the line, and the polygon or area. A point is defined \\nby x and y coordinates, a line is defined by two points, and a polygon is defined by a minimum of three \\npoints. The important thing to note is that the definition of a point is analogous to a location that is \\ndefined by longitude and latitude. Furthermore, since lines and polygons are made up of points, location \\ninformation (i.e., x and y, or longitude and latitude, coordinates) is intrinsic to points, lines, and polygons. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  55 \\nFigure 2.14 Geographic Features as Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nBoth simple and complex maps can be made using these three relatively simple geometric objects. \\nAdditionally, by changing the graphical characteristics of each object, an infinite number of mapping \\npossibilities emerge. Such changes can be made to the respective size, shape, color, and patterns of points, \\nlines, and polygons. For instance, different sized points can be used to reflect variations in population \\nsize, line color or line size (i.e., thickness) can be used to denote volume or the amount of interaction \\nbetween locations, and different colors and shapes can be used to reflect different values of interest.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  56 \\nFigure 2.15 Variations in the Graphical Parameters of Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nFigure 2.16 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  57 \\nComplementing the graphical elements described previously is annotation or text. Annotation is used to \\nidentify particular geographic features, such as cities, states, bodies of water, or other points of i nterest. \\nLike the graphical elements, text can be varied according to size, orientation, or color. There are also \\nnumerous text fonts and styles that are incorporated into maps. For example, bodies of water are often \\nlabeled in italics. \\nAnother map element that deserves to be mentioned and that combines both graphics and text is the map \\nlegend or map key. A map legend provides users information about the how geographic information is \\nrepresented graphically. Legends usually consist of a title that describes the map, as well as the various \\nsymbols, colors, and patterns that are used on the map. Such information is often vital to the proper \\ninterpretation of a map. \\nAs more features and graphical elements are put on a given map, the need to generalize such feat ures \\narises. Map generalization refers to the process of resolving conflicts associated with too much detail, too \\nmany features, or too much information to map. In particular, generalization can take several forms \\n(Buttenfield and McMaster 1991): [2] \\n\u2022 The simplification or symbolization of features for emphasis \\n\u2022 The masking or displacement of detail to increase clarity or legibility  \\n\u2022 The selection of detail for inclusion or omission from the map \\n\u2022 The exaggeration of features for emphasis \\nDetermining which aspects of generalization to use is largely a matter of personal preference, experience, \\nmap purpose, and trial and error. Though there are general guidelines about map generalization, there are \\nno universal standards or requirements with regard to the generalization of maps and mapping. It is at \\nthis point that cartographic and artistic license, prejudices and biases, and creativity and design sense \u2014 or \\nlack thereof\u2014 emerge to shape the map. \\nMaking a map and, more generally, the process of mapping involve a range of decisions and choices. From \\nthe selection of the appropriate map scale and map projection to deciding which features to map and to \\nomit, mapping is a complex blend of art and science. In fact, many historical maps are indeed viewed like \\nworks of art, and rightly so. Learning about the scale, shape, and content of maps serves to increase our Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  58 \\nunderstanding of maps, as well as deepen our appreciation of maps and map making. Ultimately, this \\nincreased geographical awareness and appreciation of maps promotes the sound and effective use and \\napplication of a GIS. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map abstraction refers to the process of explicitly defining and representing real -world features on a \\nmap. \\n\u2022 The three basic geometric forms of geographical features are the point, line, a nd polygon (or area). \\n\u2022 Map generalization refers to resolving conflicts that arise on a map due to limited space, too many \\ndetails, or too much information. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Such maps can be found on the news, \\nthe Internet, in your car, and on your mobile phone. What\u2019s more is that such images are in living color \\nand of very high resolution. Not long ago, such image maps from satellites were the sole domain of \\nmeteorologists, local weather forecasters, and various government agencies. Public access to such images \\nwas pretty much limited to the evening news. \\nTechnological advances in imaging technology, in conjunction with the commercialization of space flight, \\nopened the door for companies like GeoEye (http://www.geoeye.com) and DigitalGlobe \\n(http://www.digitalglobe.com) to provide satellite imagery and maps to the masses at the turn of the \\ntwenty-first century.

What\u2019s more is that \\nthe process of mapping has also been decentralized and democratized so that many more people not \\nonly have access to maps but also are enabled and empowered to create their own maps. This \\ndemocratization of maps and mapping is in large part attributable to a shift to digital map \\nproduction and consumption. Unlike analog or hardcopy maps that are static or fixed once they are \\nprinted onto paper, digital maps are highly changeable, exchangeable, and as noted in Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", dynamic in terms of scale, form, and content. \\nTo understand digital maps and mapping, it is necessary to put them into the context of computing \\nand information technology. First, this chapter provides an introduction to the building blocks of \\ndigital maps and geographic information systems (GISs), with particular emphasis placed upon how \\ndata and information are stored as files on a computer. Second, key issues and considerations as they \\nrelate to data acquisition and data standards are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion \\nof where data for use with a GIS can be found. This chapter serves as the bridge between the \\nconceptual materials presented in Chapter 1 \"Introduction\" and Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\"and the \\nchapters that follow, which contain more formal discussions about the use and application of a GIS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  61 \\n3.1 Data and Information \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to define and describe data and information and how it is organized into \\nfiles for use in a computing and geographic information system (GIS) environment.  \\nTo understand how we get from analog to digital maps, let\u2019s begin with the building blocks and \\nfoundations of the geographic information system (GIS)\u2014 namely, data and information. As already \\nnoted on several occasions, GIS stores, edits, processes, and presents data and information. But what \\nexactly is data? And what exactly is information? For many, the terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d refer \\nto the same thing. For our purposes, it is useful to make a distinction between the two. \\nGenerally, data refer to facts, measurements, characteristics, or traits of an object of interest. For \\nyou grammar sticklers out there, note that \u201cdata\u201d is the plural form of \u201cdatum.\u201d For example, we can \\ncollect all kinds of data about all kinds of things, like the length of rainbow trout in a Colorado \\nstream, the number of vegetarians in Alaska, the diameter of mahogany tree trunks in the Brazilian \\nrainforest, student scores on the last GIS midterm, the altitude of mountain peaks in Nepal, the \\ndepth of snow in the Austrian Alps, or the number of people who use public transportation to get to \\nwork in London. \\nOnce data are put into context, used to answer questions, situated within analytical frameworks, or \\nused to obtain insights, they become information. For our purposes, information simply refers to \\nthe knowledge of value obtained through the collection, interpretation, and/or analysis of data. \\nThough a computer is not necessary to collect, record, manipulate, process, or visualize data, or to \\nprocess it into information, information technology can be of great help. For instance, computers can \\nautomate repetitive tasks, store data efficiently in terms of space and cost, and provide a range of \\ntools for analyzing data from spreadsheets to GISs, of course. What\u2019s more is the fact that the \\nincredible amount of data collected each and every day by satellites, grocery store product scanners, \\ntraffic sensors, temperature gauges, and your mobile phone carrier, to name just a few, would not be \\npossible without the aid and innovation of information technology. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  62 \\nSince this is a text about GISs, it is useful to also define geographic data. Like generic \\ndata, geographic or spatial data refer to geographic facts, measurements, or characteristics of an \\nobject that permit us to define its location on the surface of the earth. Such data include but are not \\nrestricted to the latitude and longitude coordinates of points of interest, street addresses, postal \\ncodes, political boundaries, and even the names of places of interest. It is also important to note and \\nreemphasize the difference between geographic data and attribute data, which was discussed \\nin Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". Where geographic data are concerned with defining the location of an \\nobject of interest, attribute data are concerned with its nongeographic traits and characteristics. \\nTo illustrate the distinction between geographic and attribute data, think about your home where \\nyou grew up or where you currently live. Within the context of this discussion, we can associate both \\ngeographic and attribute data to it. For instance, we can define the location of your home many ways, \\nsuch as with a street address, the street names of the nearest intersection, the postal code where your \\nhome is located, or we could use a global positioning system\u2013enabled device to obtain latitude and \\nlongitude coordinates. What is important is geographic data permit us to define the location of an \\nobject (i.e., your home) on the surface of the earth. \\nIn addition to the geographic data that define the location of your home are the attribute data that \\ndescribe the various qualities of your home. Such data include but are not restricted to the number of \\nbedrooms and bathrooms in your home, whether or not your home has central heat, the year when \\nyour home was built, the number of occupants, and whether or not there is a swimming pool. These \\nattribute data tell us a lot about your home but relatively little about where it is. \\nNot only is it useful to recognize and understand how geographic and attribute data differ and \\ncomplement each other, but it is also of central importance when learning about and using GISs. \\nBecause a GIS requires and integrates these two distinct types of data, being able to differentiate \\nbetween geographic and attribute data is the first step in organizing your GIS. Furthermore, being \\nable to determine which kinds of data you need will ultimately aid in your implementation and use of \\na GIS. More often than not, and in the age and context of information technology, the data and \\ninformation discussed thus far is the stuff of computer files, which are the focus of the next section. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  63 \\nOf Files and Formats\u2026 \\nWhen we collect data about your home, rainforests, or anything, really, we usually need to put them \\nsomewhere. Though we may scribble numbers and measures on the back of an envelope or write them \\ndown on a pad of paper, if we want to update, share, analyze, or map them in the future, it is often useful \\nto record them in digital form so a computer can read them. Though we won\u2019t bother ourselves with the \\nbits and bytes of computing, it is necessary to discuss some basic elements of computing that are both \\nrelevant and required when learning and working with a GIS. \\nOne of the most common elements of working with computers and computing itself is the file. Files in a \\ncomputer can contain any number of things from a complex set of instructions (e.g., a computer program) \\nto a list of numbers and letters (e.g., address book). Furthermore, computer files come in all different sizes \\nand types. One of the clues we can use to distinguish one file from another is the file extension. The file \\nextension refers to the letters that follow the period (\u201c.\u201d) after the name of the file. Table 3.1 contains some \\nof the most common file extensions and the types of files with which they are associated.  \\nTable 3.1 \\nfilename.txt Simple text file \\nfilename.doc Microsoft Word document \\nfilename.pdf Adobe portable document format \\nfilename.jpg Compressed image file \\nfilename.tif Tagged image format \\nfilename.html Hypertext markup language (used to create web pages) \\nfilename.xml Extensible markup language \\nfilename.zip Zipped/compressed archive \\nSome computer programs may be able to read or work with only certain file types, while others are more \\nadept at reading multiple file formats. What you will realize as you begin to work  more with information \\ntechnology, and GISs in particular, is that familiarity with different file types is important. Learning how \\nto convert or export one file type to another is also a very useful and valuable skill to obtain. In this \\nregard, being able to recognize and knowing how to identify different and unfamiliar file types will \\nundoubtedly increase your proficiency with computers and GISs. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  64 \\nOf the numerous file types that exist, one of the most common and widely accessed file is the simple \\ntext, plain text, or just text file. Simple text files can be read widely by word processing programs, \\nspreadsheet and database programs, and web browsers. Often ending with the extension \u201c.txt\u201d \\n(i.e.,filename.txt), text files contain no special formatting (e.g., bold, italic, underlining) and contain only \\nalphanumeric characters. In other words, images or complex graphics are not well suited for text files. \\nText files, however, are ideal for recording, sharing, and exchanging data because most computers and \\noperating systems can recognize and read simple text files with programs called text editors.  \\nWhen a text file contains data that are organized or structured in some fashion, it is sometimes called a \\nflat file (but the file extension remains the same, i.e., .txt). Generally, flat files are organized in a tabular \\nformat or line by line. In other words, each line or row of the file contains one and only one record. So if \\nwe collected height measurements on three people, Tim, Jake, and Harry, the file might look som ething \\nlike this: \\nName Height \\nTim 6\u20191\u201d \\nJake 5\u20199\u201d \\nHarry 6\u20192\u201d \\nEach row corresponds to one and only one record, observation or case. There are two other important \\nelements to know about this file. First, note that the first row does not contain any data; rather, it provides \\na description of the data contained in each column. When the first row of a file contains such descriptors, \\nit is referred to as a header row or just a header. Columns in a flat file are also called \\nfields, variables, or attributes. \u201cHeight\u201d is the attribute, field, or variable that we are interested in, and \\nthe observations or cases in our data set are \u201cTim,\u201d \u201cJake,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d In short, rows are for records; \\ncolumns are for fields. \\nThe second unseen but critical element to the file is the spaces in between each column or field. In the \\nexample, it appears as though a space separates the \u201cname\u201d column from the \u201cheight\u201d column. Upon \\ncloser inspection, however, note how the initial values of the \u201cheight\u201d column are aligned. If a single space \\nwas being used to separate each column, the height column would not be aligned. In this case a tab is \\nbeing used to separate the columns of each row. The character that is used to separate columns within a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  65 \\nflat file is called the delimiter or separator. Though any character can be used as a delimiter, the most \\ncommon delimiters are the tab, the comma, and a single space. The following are examples of each.  \\nTab-Delimited Single-Space-Delimited Comma-Delimited \\nName     Height Name Height Name, Height \\nTim     6.1 Tim 6.1 Tim, 6.1 \\nJake     5.9 Jake 5.9 Jake, 5.9 \\nHarry     6.2 Harry 6.2 Harry, 6.2 \\nKnowing the delimiter to a flat file is important because it enables us to distinguish and separate the \\ncolumns efficiently and without error. Sometimes such files are referred to by their delimiter, such as a \\n\u201ccomma-separated values\u201d file or a \u201ctab-delimited\u201d file. \\nWhen recording and working with geographic data, the same general format is applied. Rows are reserved \\nfor records, or in the case of geographic data, locations and columns or fields are used for the attributes or \\nvariables associated with each location. For example, the following tab-delimited flat file contains data for \\nthree places (i.e., countries) and three attributes or characteristics of eac h country (i.e., population, \\nlanguage, continent) as noted by the header. \\nCountry Population Language Continent \\nFrance 65,000,000 French Europe \\nBrazil 192,000,000 Portuguese South America \\nAustralia 22,000,000 English Australia \\nFiles like those presented here are the building blocks of the various tables, charts, reports, graphs, and \\nother visualizations that we see each and every day online, in print, and on television. They are also key \\ncomponents to the maps and geographic representations created by GISs. Rarely if ever, however, will you \\nwork with one and only one file or file type. More often than not, and especially when working with GISs, \\nyou will work with multiple files. Such a grouping of multiple files is called a  database. Since the files \\nwithin a database may be different sizes, shapes, and even formats, we need to devise some type of system \\nthat will allow us to work, update, edit, integrate, share, and display the various data within the database. \\nSuch a system is generally referred to as a database management system (DBMS). Databases and DBMSs \\nare so important to GISs that a later chapter is dedicated to them. For now it is enough to remember that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  66 \\nfile types are like ice cream\u2014 they come in all different kinds of flavors. In light of such variety, Section 3.2 \\n\"Data about Data\" details some of the key issues that need to be considered when acquiring and working \\nwith data and information for GISs. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Data refer to specific facts, measurements, or characteristics of objects and phenomena of interest.  \\n\u2022 Information refers to knowledge of value that is obtained from the analysis of data.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the difference between primary and secondary data sources \\nand to understand the importance of metadata and data standards.  \\nConsider the following comma-delimited file: \\ncity, sun, temp, precip \\nLos Angeles, 300, 70, 10 \\nLondon, 50, 55, 40 \\nSingapore, 330, 80, 60 \\nLooking at the contents of the file, we can see that it contains data about the cities of Los Angeles, \\nLondon, and Singapore. As noted, each field or attribute is separated by a comma, and the file also \\ncontains a header row that tells us about the data contained in each column. Or does it? What does \\nthe column \u201csun\u201d refer to? Is it the number of sunny days this year, last year, annually, or when? \\nWhat about \u201ctemp\u201d? Does this refer to the average daytime, evening, or annual temperature? For \\nthat matter, how is temperature measured? In Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin? The column \u201cprecip\u201d \\nprobably refers to precipitation, but again, what are the units or time frame for such measures and \\ndata? Finally, where did these data come from? Who collected them, when were they collected and \\nfor what purpose? \\nIt is amazing to think that such a small text file can lead to so many questions. Now let\u2019s extend the \\nexample to a file with one hundred records on ten variables, one thousand records on one hundred \\nvariables or better yet, ten thousand records on one thousand variables. Through this rather simple \\nexample, a number of general but central issues that are related to data emerge. Such issues range \\nfrom the relatively mundane naming conventions that are used to identify individual records (i.e., \\nrows) and distinguish one field (i.e., column) from another, to the issue of providing documentation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  68 \\nabout what data are included in a given file; when the data were collected; for what purpose are the \\ndata to be used; who collected them; and, of course, where did the data come from? \\nThe previous simple text file illustrates how we cannot and should not take data and information for \\ngranted. It also highlights two important concepts with regard to the source of data and to the \\ncontents of data files. With regard to data sources, data can be put into one of two distinct categories. \\nThe first category is called primary data. Primary data refer to data that are collected directly or on a \\nfirsthand basis. For example, if you wanted to examine the variability of local temperatures in the \\nmonth of May, and you recorded the temperature at noon every day in May, you would be \\nconstructing a primary data set. Conversely, secondary data refer to data collected by someone else or \\nsome other party. For instance, when we work with census or economic data collected and \\ndistributed by the government, we are using secondary data. \\nSeveral factors influence the decision behind the construction and use of primary data sets versus \\nsecondary data sets. Among the most important factors are the costs associated with data acquisition \\nin terms of money, availability, and time. In fact, the data acquisition and integration phase of most \\ngeographic information system (GIS) projects is often the most time consuming. In other words, \\nlocating, obtaining, and putting together the data to be used for a GIS project, whether you collect \\nthe data yourself or use secondary data, may indeed take up most of your time. Of course, depending \\non the purpose, availability, and need, it may not be necessary to construct an entirely new data set \\n(i.e., primary data set). In light of the vast amounts of data and information that are publicly \\navailable, for example, via the Internet, the cost and time savings of using secondary data often offset \\nany benefits that are associated with primary data collection. \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of the difference between primary and secondary data, as \\nwell as the rationale behind each, how do we go about finding the data and information that we \\nneed? As noted earlier, there is an incredibly vast and growing amount of data and information \\navailable to us, and performing an online search for \u201cdeforestation data\u201d will return hundreds\u2014 if not \\nthousands\u2014 of results. To overcome this data and information overload we need to turn to\u2026even \\nmore data. In particular, we are looking for a special kind of data called metadata. Simply defined, \\nmetadata are data about data. At one level, a header row in a simple text file like those discussed in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  69 \\nthe previous section is analogous to metadata. The header row provides data (e.g., names and labels) \\nabout the subsequent rows of data. \\nHeader rows themselves, however, may need additional explanation as previously illustrated. \\nFurthermore, when working with or searching through several data sets, it can be quite tedious at \\nbest or impossible at worst to open each and every file in order to determine its contents and \\nusability. Enter metadata. Today many files, and in particular secondary data sets, come with a \\nmetadata file. These metadata files contain items such as general descriptions about the contents of \\nthe file, definitions for the various terms used to identify records (rows) and fields (fields), the range \\nof values for fields, the quality or reliability of the data and measurements, how the data were \\ncollected, when the data were collected, and who collected the data. Though not all data are \\naccompanied by metadata, it is easy to see and understand why metadata are important and valuable \\nwhen searching for secondary data, as well as when constructing primary data that may be shared in \\nthe future. \\nJust as simple files come in all shapes, sizes, and formats, so too do metadata. As the amount and \\navailability of data and information increase each and every day, metadata play a critical role in \\nmaking sense of it all. The class of metadata that we are most concerned with when working with a \\nGIS is calledgeospatial metadata. As the name suggests, geospatial metadata are data about \\ngeographical and spatial data. According to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in the \\nUnited States (see http://www.fgdc.gov), \u201cGeospatial metadata are used to document geographic \\ndigital resources such as GIS files, geospatial databases, and earth imagery. A geospatial metadata \\nrecord includes core library catalog elements such as Title, Abstract, and Publication Data; \\ngeographic elements such as Geographic Extent and Projection Information; and database elements \\nsuch as Attribute Label Definitions and Attribute Domain Values.\u201d The definition of geospatial \\nmetadata is about improving transparency when it comes to data, as well as promoting standards. \\nTake a few moments to explore and examine the contents of a geospatial metadata file that conforms \\nto the FGDC here. \\nGenerally, standards refer to widely promoted, accepted, and followed rules and practices. Given the \\nrange and variability of data and data sources, identifying a common thread to locate and understand Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  70 \\nthe contents of any given file can be a challenge. Just as the rules of grammar and mathematics \\nprovide the foundations for communication and numeric calculations, respectively, metadata \\nprovide similar frameworks for working with and sharing data and information from various \\nsources. \\nThe central point behind metadata is that it facilitates data and information sharing. Within the \\ncontext of large organizations such as governments, data and information sharing can eliminate \\nredundancies and increase efficiencies. Moreover, access to data and information promotes the \\nintegration of different data that can improve analyses, inform decisions, and shape policy. The role \\nthat metadata\u2014 and in particular geospatial metadata\u2014 play in the world of GISs is critical and offers \\nenormous benefits in terms of cost and time savings. It is precisely the sharing, widespread \\ndistribution and integration of various geographic and nongeographic data and information, enabled \\nby metadata, that drive some of the most interesting and compelling innovations in GISs and the \\nbroader geospatial information technology community. More important, widespread access, \\ndistribution, and sharing of geographic data and information have important social costs and \\nbenefits and yield better analyses and more informed decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Primary data refer to data that are obtained via direct observation or measure, and secondary data refer \\nto data collected by a different party. \\n\u2022 Data acquisition is among the most time-consuming aspects of any GIS project. \\n\u2022 Metadata are data about data and promote data exchange, dissemination, and integration.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the costs and benefits of using primary data instead of secondary data?  \\n2. Refer to the Federal Geographic Data Committee website (http://www.fgdc.gov) and describe in detail \\nwhat information should be included in a metadata file. Why are metadata and standards important?  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  71 \\n3.3 Finding Data \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to identify and evaluate key considerations when searching for data.  \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of data and information, where can we find such data and \\ninformation? Though an Internet search will certainly come up with myriad sources and types of \\ndata, the hunt for relevant and useful data is often a challenging and iterative process. Therefore, \\nprior to hopping online and downloading the first thing that appears from a web search, it is useful \\nto frame our search for data with the following questions and considerations: \\n1. What exactly is the purpose of the data? Given the fact the world is swimming in va st amounts of \\ndata, articulating why we need (or why we don\u2019t need) a given set of data will streamline the \\nsearch for useful and relevant data. To this end, the more specific we can be about the purpose of \\nthe needed data, the more efficient our search for data will be. For example, if we are interested in \\nunderstanding and studying economic growth, it is useful to determine both temporal and \\ngeographic scales. In other words, for what time periods (e.g., 1850 \u20131900) and intervals (e.g., \\nquarterly, annually) are we interested, and at what level of analysis (e.g., national, regional, \\nstate)? Oftentimes, data availability, or more specifically, the lack of relevant data, will force us to \\nchange the purpose or scope of our original question. A clear purpose will yield a more efficient \\nsearch for data and enables us to accept or discard quickly the various data sets that we may come \\nacross. \\n2. The second question we need to ask ourselves is what data already exist and to what data do we \\nhave access already? Prior to searching for new data, it is always a good idea to take an inventory \\nof the data that we already have. Such data may be from previous projects or analyses, or from \\ncolleagues and classmates, but the key point here is that we can save a lot of time and ef fort by \\nusing data that we already possess. Furthermore, by identifying what we have, we get a better \\nunderstanding of what we need. For instance, though we may already have census data (i.e., \\nattribute data), we may need updated geographic data that conta ins the boundaries of US states \\nor counties. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  72 \\n3. Next, we need to assess and evaluate the costs associated with data acquisition. Data acquisition \\ncosts go beyond financial costs. Just as important as the financial costs to data are those that \\ninvolve your time. After all, time is money. The time and energy you spend on collecting, finding, \\ncleaning, and formatting data are time and energy taken away from data analysis. Depending on \\ndeadlines, time constraints, and deliverables, it is critical to learn how to m anage your time when \\nlooking for data. \\n4. Finally, the format of the data that is needed is of critical importance. Though many programs can \\nread many formats of data, there are some data types that can only be read by some programs and \\nsome programs that require particular data formats. Understanding what data formats you can \\nuse and those that you cannot will aid in your search for data. For instance, one of the most \\ncommon forms of geographic information system (GIS) data is called the  shapefile. Not all GIS \\nprograms can read or use shapefiles, but it may be necessary to convert to or from a shapefile or \\nsome other format. Hence, as noted earlier, the more data formats with which we are familiar, the \\nbetter off we will be in our search for data because we will have an understanding of not only what \\nwe can use but also what format conversions will need to be made if necessary.  \\nAll these questions are of equal importance and being able to answer them will assist in a more \\nefficient and effective search for data. Obviously, there are several other considerations behind the \\nsearch for data, and in particular GIS data, but those listed here provide an initial pathway to a \\nsuccessful search for data. \\nAs information technology evolves, and as more and more data are collected and distributed, the \\nvarious forms of data that can be used with a GIS increases. Generally, and as discussed previously, a \\nGIS uses and integrates two types of data: geographic data and attribute data. Sometimes the source \\nof both geographic and attribute data are one in the same. For instance, the US Bureau of Census \\n(http://www.census.gov) distributes geographic boundary files (e.g., census tract level, county level, \\nstate level) as well as the associated attribute data (e.g., population, race/ethnicity, income). What\u2019s \\nmore is that such data are freely available at no charge. In many respects, US census data are \\nexceptional: they are free and comprehensive. If only all data were free and comprehensive! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  73 \\nObviously, each and every search for data will vary according to purpose, but data from governments \\ntend to have good coverage and provide a point of reference from which other data can be added, \\ncompared, and evaluated. Whether you need satellite imagery data from the National Aeronautics \\nand Space Administration (http://www.nasa.gov) or land use data from the United States Geological \\nSurvey (http://www.usgs.gov), such government sources tend to be reliable, reputable, and \\nconsistent. Another key element of most government data is that they are freely accessible to the \\npublic. In other words, there is no charge to use or to acquire the data. Data that are free to use are \\ngenerally called public data. \\nUnlike publicly available data, there are numerous sources of private or proprietary data. The main \\ndifference between public and private data is that the former tend to be free, and the latter must be \\nacquired at a cost. Furthermore, there are often restrictions on the redistribution and dissemination \\nof proprietary data sets (i.e., sharing the purchased data is not allowed). Again, depending on the \\nsubject matter, proprietary data may be the only option. Another reason for using proprietary data is \\nthat the data may be formatted and cleaned according to your needs. The trade-off between financial \\ncost and time saved is one that must be seriously considered and evaluated when working with \\ndeadlines. \\nThe search for data, and in particular the data that you need, is often the most time consuming \\naspect of any GIS-related project. Therefore, it is critical to try to define and clarify your data \\nrequirements and needs\u2014 from the temporal and geographic scales of data to the formats required\u2014\\nas clearly as possible and as early as possible. Such definition and clarity will pay dividends in your \\nsearch for the right data, which in turn will yield better analyses and well-informed decisions. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n\u2022 Prior to searching for data, ask yourself the following questions: Why do I need the data? At what time \\nscale do I need the data? At what geographic scale do I want the data? What data already exist? What \\nformat do I need the data? \\n \\nEXERCISES  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  74 \\n1.

Data models are a set of rules and/or constructs used to describe and represent aspects of the \\nreal world in a computer. Two primary data models are available to complete this task: raster data \\nmodels and vector data models. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  76 \\n4.1 Raster Data Models \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to understand how raster data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nThe raster data model is widely used in applications ranging far beyond geographic information \\nsystems (GISs). Most likely, you are already very familiar with this data model if you have any \\nexperience with digital photographs. The ubiquitous JPEG, BMP, and TIFF file formats (among \\nothers) are based on the raster data model (see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section \\n5.3 \"File Formats\"). Take a moment to view your favorite digital image. If you zoom deeply into the \\nimage, you will notice that it is composed of an array of tiny square pixels (or picture elements). Each \\nof these uniquely colored pixels, when viewed as a whole, combines to form a coherent image (Figure \\n4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nFigure 4.1 Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image \\n \\nFurthermore, all liquid crystal display (LCD) computer monitors are based on raster technology as \\nthey are composed of a set number of rows and columns of pixels. Notably, the foundation of this \\ntechnology predates computers and digital cameras by nearly a century. The neoimpressionist artist, \\nGeorges Seurat, developed a painting technique referred to as \u201cpointillism\u201d in the 1880s, which \\nsimilarly relies on the amassing of small, monochromatic \u201cdots\u201d of ink that combine to form a larger \\nimage (Figure 4.2 \"Pointillist Artwork\"). If you are as generous as the author, you may indeed think \\nof your raster dataset creations as sublime works of art. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  77 \\nFigure 4.2 Pointillist Artwork \\n \\nThe raster data model consists of rows and columns of equally sized pixels interconnected to form a \\nplanar surface. These pixels are used as building blocks for creating points, lines, areas, networks, \\nand surfaces (Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Figure 2.6 \"Map Overlay Process\" illustrates how a land \\nparcel can be converted to a raster representation). Although pixels may be triangles, hexagons, or \\neven octagons, square pixels represent the simplest geometric form with which to work. Accordingly, \\nthe vast majority of available raster GIS data are built on the square pixel (Figure 4.3 \"Common \\nRaster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and USGS DEM (right)\"). These \\nsquares are typically reformed into rectangles of various dimensions if the data model is transformed \\nfrom one projection to another (e.g., from State Plane coordinates to UTM [Universal Transverse \\nMercator] coordinates). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  78 \\nFigure 4.3 Common Raster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and \\nUSGS DEM (right) \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nBecause of the reliance on a uniform series of square pixels, the raster data model is referred to as a \\ngrid-based system. Typically, a single data value will be assigned to each grid locale. Each cell in a \\nraster carries a single value, which represents the characteristic of the spatial phenomenon at a \\nlocation denoted by its row and column. The data type for that cell value can be either integer or \\nfloating-point (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1 \"Geographic Data \\nAcquisition\"). Alternatively, the raster graphic can reference a database management system wherein \\nopen-ended attribute tables can be used to associate multiple data values to each pixel. The advance \\nof computer technology has made this second methodology increasingly feasible as large datasets are \\nno longer constrained by computer storage issues as they were previously. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  79 \\nThe raster model will average all values within a given pixel to yield a single value. Therefore, the \\nmore area covered per pixel, the less accurate the associated data values. The area covered by each \\npixel determines thespatial resolution of the raster model from which it is derived. Specifically, \\nresolution is determined by measuring one side of the square pixel. A raster model with pixels \\nrepresenting 10 m by 10 m (or 100 square meters) in the real world would be said to have a spatial \\nresolution of 10 m; a raster model with pixels measuring 1 km by 1 km (1 square kilometer) in the \\nreal world would be said to have a spatial resolution of 1 km; and so forth. \\nCare must be taken when determining the resolution of a raster because using an overly coarse pixel \\nresolution will cause a loss of information, whereas using overly fine pixel resolution will result in \\nsignificant increases in file size and computer processing requirements during display and/or \\nanalysis. An effective pixel resolution will take both the map scale and the minimum mapping unit of \\nthe other GIS data into consideration. In the case of raster graphics with coarse spatial resolution, \\nthe data values associated with specific locations are not necessarily explicit in the raster data model. \\nFor example, if the location of telephone poles were mapped on a coarse raster graphic, it would be \\nclear that the entire cell would not be filled by the pole. Rather, the pole would be assumed to be \\nlocated somewhere within that cell (typically at the center). \\nImagery employing the raster data model must exhibit several properties. First, each pixel must hold \\nat least one value, even if that data value is zero. Furthermore, if no data are present for a given pixel, \\na data value placeholder must be assigned to this grid cell. Often, an arbitrary, readily identifiable \\nvalue (e.g., \u22129999) will be assigned to pixels for which there is no data value. Second, a cell can hold \\nany alphanumeric index that represents an attribute. In the case of quantitative datasets, attribute \\nassignation is fairly straightforward. For example, if a raster image denotes elevation, the data values \\nfor each pixel would be some indication of elevation, usually in feet or meters. In the case of \\nqualitative datasets, data values are indices that necessarily refer to some predetermined \\ntranslational rule. In the case of a land-use/land-cover raster graphic, the following rule may be \\napplied: 1 = grassland, 2 = agricultural, 3 = disturbed, and so forth (Figure 4.4 \"Land-Use/Land-\\nCover Raster Image\"). The third property of the raster data model is that points and lines \u201cmove\u201d to \\nthe center of the cell. As one might expect, if a 1 km resolution raster image contains a river or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  80 \\nstream, the location of the actual waterway within the \u201criver\u201d pixel will be unclear. Therefore, there is \\na general assumption that all zero-dimensional (point) and one-dimensional (line) features will be \\nlocated toward the center of the cell. As a corollary, the minimum width for any line feature must \\nnecessarily be one cell regardless of the actual width of the feature. If it is not, the feature will not be \\nrepresented in the image and will therefore be assumed to be absent. \\nFigure 4.4 Land-Use/Land-Cover Raster Image \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  81 \\nSeveral methods exist for encoding raster data from scratch. Three of these models are as follows: \\n1. Cell-by-cell raster encoding. This minimally intensive method encodes a raster by creating \\nrecords for each cell value by row and column (Figure 4.5 \"Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThis method could be thought of as a large spreadsheet wherein each cell of the spreadsheet \\nrepresents a pixel in the raster image. This method is also referred to as \u201cexhaustive \\nenumeration.\u201d \\n2. Run-length raster encoding. This method encodes cell values in runs of similarly valued pixels \\nand can result in a highly compressed image file (Figure 4.6 \"Run-Length Encoding of Raster \\nData\"). The run-length encoding method is useful in situations where large groups of neighboring \\npixels have similar values (e.g., discrete datasets such as land use/land cover or habitat \\nsuitability) and is less useful where neighboring pixel values vary widely (e.g., continuous datasets \\nsuch as elevation or sea-surface temperatures). \\n3. Quad-tree raster encoding. This method divides a raster into a hierarchy of quadrants that are \\nsubdivided based on similarly valued pixels (Figure 4.7 \"Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThe division of the raster stops when a quadrant is made entirely from cells of the same value. A \\nquadrant that cannot be subdivided is called a \u201cleaf node.\u201d \\nFigure 4.5 Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  82 \\nFigure 4.6 Run-Length Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  83 \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Raster Model \\nThe use of a raster data model confers many advantages. First, the technology required to create raster \\ngraphics is inexpensive and ubiquitous. Nearly everyone currently owns some sort of raster image \\ngenerator, namely a digital camera, and few cellular phones are sold today that don\u2019t include such \\nfunctionality. Similarly, a plethora of satellites are constantly beaming up -to-the-minute raster graphics \\nto scientific facilities across the globe (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3 \"File \\nFormats\"). These graphics are often posted online for private and/or public use, occasionally at no cost to \\nthe user. \\nAdditional advantages of raster graphics are the relative simplicity of the underlying data structure. Each \\ngrid location represented in the raster image correlates to a single value (or series of values if attributes \\ntables are included). This simple data structure may also help explain why it is relatively easy to perform \\noverlay analyses on raster data (for more on overlay analyses, see Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector \\nOperations\", Section 7.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\"). This simplicity also lends itself to easy interpretation \\nand maintenance of the graphics, relative to its vector counterpart.  \\nDespite the advantages, there are also several disadvantages to using the raster data model. The first \\ndisadvantage is that raster files are typically very large. Particu larly in the case of raster images built from \\nthe cell-by-cell encoding methodology, the sheer number of values stored for a given dataset result in \\npotentially enormous files. Any raster file that covers a large area and has somewhat finely resolved pixel s \\nwill quickly reach hundreds of megabytes in size or more. These large files are only getting larger as the \\nquantity and quality of raster datasets continues to keep pace with quantity and quality of computer \\nresources and raster data collectors (e.g., digital cameras, satellites). \\nA second disadvantage of the raster model is that the output images are less \u201cpretty\u201d than their vector \\ncounterparts. This is particularly noticeable when the raster images are enlarged or zoomed (refer \\nto Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\" ). Depending on how \\nfar one zooms into a raster image, the details and coherence of that image will quickly be lost amid a \\npixilated sea of seemingly randomly colored grid cells. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  84 \\nThe geometric transformations that arise during map reprojection efforts can cause problems for raster \\ngraphics and represent a third disadvantage to using the raster data model. As described in  Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.2 \"Map Scale, Coordinate Systems, and Map Projections\", changing map \\nprojections will alter the size and shape of the original input layer and frequently result in the loss or \\naddition of pixels (White 2006). [1] These alterations will result in the perfect square pixels of the input \\nlayer taking on some alternate rhomboidal dimensions. However, the problem is larger than a simple \\nreformation of the square pixel. Indeed, the reprojection of a raster image dataset from one projection to \\nanother brings change to pixel values that may, in turn, significantly alter the output information (Seong \\n2003). [2] \\nThe final disadvantage of using the raster data model is that it is not suitable for some types of spatial \\nanalyses. For example, difficulties arise when attempting to overlay and analyze multiple raster  graphics \\nproduced at differing scales and pixel resolutions. Combining information from a raster image with 10 m \\nspatial resolution with a raster image with 1 km spatial resolution will most likely produce nonsensical \\noutput information as the scales of analysis are far too disparate to result in meaningful and/or \\ninterpretable conclusions. In addition, some network and spatial analyses (i.e., determining directionality \\nor geocoding) can be problematic to perform on raster data. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Raster data are derived from a grid-based system of contiguous cells containing specific attribute \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The spatial resolution of a raster dataset represents a measure of the accuracy or detail of the displayed \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The raster data model is widely used by non-GIS technologies such as digital cameras/pictures and LCD \\nmonitors. \\n\u2022 Care should be taken to determine whether the raster or vector data model is best suited for your data \\nand/or analytical needs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how vector data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nIn contrast to the raster data model is the vector data model. In this model, space is not quantized \\ninto discrete grid cells like the raster model. Vector data models use points and their associated X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs to represent the vertices of spatial features, much as if they were being drawn on a \\nmap by hand (Aronoff 1989). [1] The data attributes of these features are then stored in a separate \\ndatabase management system. The spatial information and the attribute information for these \\nmodels are linked via a simple identification number that is given to each feature in a map. \\nThree fundamental vector types exist in geographic information systems (GISs): points, lines, and \\npolygons (Figure 4.8 \"Points, Lines, and Polygons\"). Points are zero-dimensional objects that contain \\nonly a single coordinate pair. Points are typically used to model singular, discrete features such as \\nbuildings, wells, power poles, sample locations, and so forth. Points have only the property of \\nlocation. Other types of point features include the node and the vertex. Specifically, a point is a stand-\\nalone feature, while a node is a topological junction representing a common X, Y coordinate pair \\nbetween intersecting lines and/or polygons. Vertices are defined as each bend along a line or polygon \\nfeature that is not the intersection of lines or polygons. \\nFigure 4.8 Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  87 \\nPoints can be spatially linked to form more complex features. Lines are one-dimensional features \\ncomposed of multiple, explicitly connected points. Lines are used to represent linear features such as \\nroads, streams, faults, boundaries, and so forth. Lines have the property of length. Lines that directly \\nconnect two nodes are sometimes referred to as chains, edges, segments, or arcs. \\nPolygons are two-dimensional features created by multiple lines that loop back to create a \u201cclosed\u201d \\nfeature. In the case of polygons, the first coordinate pair (point) on the first line segment is the same \\nas the last coordinate pair on the last line segment. Polygons are used to represent features such as \\ncity boundaries, geologic formations, lakes, soil associations, vegetation communities, and so forth. \\nPolygons have the properties of area and perimeter. Polygons are also called areas. \\nVector Data Models Structures \\nVector data models can be structured many different ways. We will examine two of the more common \\ndata structures here. The simplest vector data structure is called the spaghetti data model (Dangermond \\n1982). [2] In the spaghetti model, each point, line, and/or polygon feature is represented as a string of X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs (or as a single X, Y coordinate pair in the case of a vector image with a single point) with \\nno inherent structure (Figure 4.9 \"Spaghetti Data Model\"). One could envision each line in this model to \\nbe a single strand of spaghetti that is formed into complex shapes by the addition of more and more \\nstrands of spaghetti. It is notable that in this model, any polygons that lie adjacent to each other must be \\nmade up of their own lines, or stands of spaghetti. In other words, each polygon must be uniquely defined \\nby its own set of X, Y coordinate pairs, even if the adjacent polygons share the exact same boundary \\ninformation. This creates some redundancies within the data model and therefore reduces efficiency. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  88 \\nFigure 4.9 Spaghetti Data Model \\n \\nDespite the location designations associated with each line, or strand of spaghetti, spatial relationships \\nare not explicitly encoded within the spaghetti model; rather, they are  implied by their location. This \\nresults in a lack of topological information, which is problematic if the user attempts to make \\nmeasurements or analysis. The computational requirements, therefore, are very steep if any advanced \\nanalytical techniques are employed on vector files structured thusly. Nevertheless, the simple structure of \\nthe spaghetti data model allows for efficient reproduction of maps and graphics as this topological \\ninformation is unnecessary for plotting and printing. \\nIn contrast to the spaghetti data model, the topological data model is characterized by the inclusion of \\ntopological information within the dataset, as the name implies. Topology is a set of rules that model the \\nrelationships between neighboring points, lines, and polygons and determines how they share geometry. \\nFor example, consider two adjacent polygons. In the spaghetti model, the shared boundary of two \\nneighboring polygons is defined as two separate, identical lines. The inclusion of topology into the data \\nmodel allows for a single line to represent this shared boundary with an explicit reference to denote which \\nside of the line belongs with which polygon. Topology is also concerned with preserving spatial properties \\nwhen the forms are bent, stretched, or placed under similar geometric transformations, which allows for \\nmore efficient projection and reprojection of map files. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  89 \\nThree basic topological precepts that are necessary to understand the topological data model are outlined \\nhere. First, connectivity describes the arc-node topology for the feature dataset. As discussed previously, \\nnodes are more than simple points. In the topological data model, nodes are the intersection points where \\ntwo or more arcs meet. In the case of arc-node topology, arcs have both a from-node (i.e., starting node) \\nindicating where the arc begins and a to-node (i.e., ending node) indicating where the arc ends (Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\"). In addition, between each node pair is a line segment, sometimes called a \\nlink, which has its own identification number and references both its from-node and to-node. In Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\", arcs 1, 2, and 3 all intersect because they share node 11. Therefore, the \\ncomputer can determine that it is possible to move along arc 1 and turn onto arc 3, whi le it is not possible \\nto move from arc 1 to arc 5, as they do not share a common node. \\nFigure 4.10 Arc-Node Topology \\n \\nThe second basic topological precept is area definition. Area definition states that an arc that connects to \\nsurround an area defines a polygon, also called polygon-arc topology. In the case of polygon-arc topology, \\narcs are used to construct polygons, and each arc is stored only once (Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc \\nTopology\"). This results in a reduction in the amount of data stored and ensures  that adjacent polygon \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  90 \\nboundaries do not overlap. In the Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc Topology\", the polygon-arc topology makes it \\nclear that polygon F is made up of arcs 8, 9, and 10. \\nFigure 4.11 Polygon-Arc Topology \\n \\nContiguity, the third topological precept, is based on the concept that polygons that share a boundary are \\ndeemed adjacent. Specifically, polygon topology requires that all arcs in a polygon have a direction (a \\nfrom-node and a to-node), which allows adjacency information to be determined (Figure 4.12 \"Polygon \\nTopology\"). Polygons that share an arc are deemed adjacent, or contiguous, and therefore the \u201cleft\u201d and \\n\u201cright\u201d side of each arc can be defined. This left and right polygon information is stored explicitly within \\nthe attribute information of the topological data model. The \u201cuniverse polygon\u201d is an essential component \\nof polygon topology that represents the external area located outside of the study area.  Figure 4.12 \\n\"Polygon Topology\" shows that arc 6 is bound on the left by polygon B and to the right by polygon C. \\nPolygon A, the universe polygon, is to the left of arcs 1, 2, and 3.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  91 \\nFigure 4.12 Polygon Topology \\n \\nTopology allows the computer to rapidly determine and analyze the spatial relationships of all its included \\nfeatures. In addition, topological information is important because it allows for efficient error detection \\nwithin a vector dataset. In the case of polygon features, open or unclosed polygons, which occur when an \\narc does not completely loop back upon itself, and unlabeled polygons, which occur when an area does not \\ncontain any attribute information, violate polygon-arc topology rules. Another topological error found \\nwith polygon features is the sliver. Slivers occur when the shared boundary of two polygons do not meet \\nexactly (Figure 4.13 \"Common Topological Errors\"). \\nIn the case of line features, topological errors occur when two lines do not meet perfectly at a node. This \\nerror is called an \u201cundershoot\u201d when the lines do not extend far enough to meet each other and an \\n\u201covershoot\u201d when the line extends beyond the feature it should connect to (Figure 4.13 \"Common \\nTopological Errors\"). The result of overshoots and undershoots is a \u201cdangling node\u201d at the end of the line. \\nDangling nodes aren\u2019t always an error, however, as they occur in the case of dead-end streets on a road \\nmap. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  92 \\nFigure 4.13 Common Topological Errors \\n \\nMany types of spatial analysis require the degree of organization offered by topologically explicit data \\nmodels. In particular, network analysis (e.g., finding the best route from one location to another) and \\nmeasurement (e.g., finding the length of a river segment) relies heavily on the concept of to - and from-\\nnodes and uses this information, along with attribute information, to calculate distances, shortest rou tes, \\nquickest routes, and so forth. Topology also allows for sophisticated neighborhood analysis such as \\ndetermining adjacency, clustering, nearest neighbors, and so forth. \\nNow that the basics of the concepts of topology have been outlined, we can begin to  better understand the \\ntopological data model. In this model, the node acts as more than just a simple point along a line or \\npolygon. The node represents the point of intersection for two or more arcs. Arcs may or may not be \\nlooped into polygons. Regardless, all nodes, arcs, and polygons are individually numbered. This \\nnumbering allows for quick and easy reference within the data model.  \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Vector Model \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  93 \\nIn comparison with the raster data model, vector data models tend to be better representations of reality \\ndue to the accuracy and precision of points, lines, and polygons over the regularly spaced grid cells of the \\nraster model. This results in vector data tending to be more aesthetically pleasing than raster data. \\nVector data also provides an increased ability to alter the scale of observation and analysis. As each \\ncoordinate pair associated with a point, line, and polygon represents an infinitesimally exact location \\n(albeit limited by the number of significant digits and/or data acquisition methodologies), zooming deep \\ninto a vector image does not change the view of a vector graphic in the way that it does a raster graphic \\n(see Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nVector data tend to be more compact in data structure, so file sizes are typically much smaller than their \\nraster counterparts. Although the ability of modern computers has minimized the importance of \\nmaintaining small file sizes, vector data often require a fraction the computer storage space when \\ncompared to raster data. \\nThe final advantage of vector data is that topology is inherent in the vector model. This topological \\ninformation results in simplified spatial analysis (e.g., error detection, network analysis, proximity \\nanalysis, and spatial transformation) when using a vector model. \\nAlternatively, there are two primary disadvantages of the vector data model. First, the data structure \\ntends to be much more complex than the simple raster data model. As the location of each vertex must be \\nstored explicitly in the model, there are no shortcuts for storing data like there are for raster models (e.g., \\nthe run-length and quad-tree encoding methodologies). \\nSecond, the implementation of spatial analysis can also be relatively complicated due to minor differences \\nin accuracy and precision between the input datasets. Similarly, the algorithms for manipulating and \\nanalyzing vector data are complex and can lead to intensive processing  requirements, particularly when \\ndealing with large datasets. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector data utilizes points, lines, and polygons to represent the spatial features in a map.

The objective of this section is to understand how satellite imagery and aerial photography are \\nimplemented in GIS applications. \\nA wide variety of satellite imagery and aerial photography is available for use in geographic \\ninformation systems (GISs). Although these products are basically raster graphics, they are \\nsubstantively different in their usage within a GIS. Satellite imagery and aerial photography provide \\nimportant contextual information for a GIS and are often used to conduct heads-up digitizing \\n(Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1.4 \"Secondary Data Capture\") whereby \\nfeatures from the image are converted into vector datasets. \\nSatellite Imagery \\nRemotely sensed satellite imagery is becoming increasingly common as satellites equipped with \\ntechnologically advanced sensors are continually being sent into space by pu blic agencies and private \\ncompanies around the globe. Satellites are used for applications such as military and civilian earth \\nobservation, communication, navigation, weather, research, and more. Currently, more than 3,000 \\nsatellites have been sent to space, with over 2,500 of them originating from Russia and the United States. \\nThese satellites maintain different altitudes, inclinations, eccentricities, synchronies, and orbital centers, \\nallowing them to image a wide variety of surface features and processes  (Figure 4.14 \"Satellites Orbiting \\nthe Earth\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  96 \\nFigure 4.14 Satellites Orbiting the Earth \\n \\nSatellites can be active or passive. Active satellites make use of remote sensors that detect reflected \\nresponses from objects that are irradiated from artificially generated energy sources. For example, active \\nsensors such as radars emit radio waves, laser sensors emit light waves, and sonar sensors emit sound \\nwaves. In all cases, the sensor emits the signal and then calculates the time it takes for the returned signal \\nto \u201cbounce\u201d back from some remote feature. Knowing the speed of the emitted signal, the time delay from \\nthe original emission to the return can be used to calculate the distance to the feature.  \\nPassive satellites, alternatively, make use of sensors that detect the reflected or emitted electromagnetic \\nradiation from natural sources. This natural source is typically the energy from the sun, but other sources \\ncan be imaged as well, such as magnetism and geothermal activity. Using an example we\u2019ve all \\nexperienced, taking a picture with a flash-enabled camera would be active remote sensing, while using a \\ncamera without a flash (i.e., relying on ambient light to illuminate the scene) would be passive remote \\nsensing. \\nThe quality and quantity of satellite imagery is largely determined by their resolution. There are four types \\nof resolution that characterize any particular remote sensor (Campbell 2002).  [1] The spatial resolution of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  97 \\na satellite image, as described previously in the raster data model se ction (Section 4.1 \"Raster Data \\nModels\"), is a direct representation of the ground coverage for each pixel shown in the image. If a satellite \\nproduces imagery with a 10 m resolution, the corresponding ground coverage for each of those pixels is 10 \\nm by 10 m, or 100 square meters on the ground. Spatial resolution is determined by the sensors\u2019 \\ninstantaneous field of view (IFOV). The IFOV is essentially the ground area through which the sensor is \\nreceiving the electromagnetic radiation signal and is determined by height and angle of the imaging \\nplatform. \\nSpectral resolution denotes the ability of the sensor to resolve wavelength intervals, also called bands, \\nwithin the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral resolution is determined by the interval size of the \\nwavelengths and the number of intervals being scanned. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are \\nthose sensors that can resolve a multitude of wavelengths intervals within the spectrum. For example, the \\nIKONOS satellite resolves images for bands at the blue (445\u2013516 nm), green (506\u201395 nm), red (632\u201398 \\nnm), and near-infrared (757\u2013853 nm) wavelength intervals on its 4-meter multispectral sensor. \\nTemporal resolution is the amount of time between each image collection period and is determined by the \\nrepeat cycle of the satellite\u2019s orbit. Temporal resolution can be thought of as true-nadir or off-nadir. Areas \\nconsidered true-nadir are those located directly beneath the sensor while off-nadir areas are those that are \\nimaged obliquely. In the case of the IKONOS satellite, the temporal resolution is 3 to 5 days for off-nadir \\nimaging and 144 days for true-nadir imaging. \\nThe fourth and final type of resolution, radiometric resolution, refers to the sensitivity of the sensor to \\nvariations in brightness and specifically denotes the number of grayscale levels that can be imaged by the \\nsensor. Typically, the available radiometric values for a sensor are 8-bit (yielding values that range from \\n0\u2013255 as 256 unique values or as 28 values); 11-bit (0\u20132,047); 12-bit (0\u20134,095); or 16-bit (0\u201363,535) \\n(see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\",Section 5.1.1 \"Data Types\" for more on bits). Landsat-7, for \\nexample, maintains 8-bit resolution for its bands and can therefore record values for each pixel that range \\nfrom 0 to 255. \\nBecause of the technical constraints associated with satellite remote sensing systems, there is a trade -off \\nbetween these different types of resolution. Improving one type of resolution often necessitates a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  98 \\nreduction in one of the other types of resolution. For example, an increase in spatial resolution is typically \\nassociated with a decrease in spectral resolution, and vice versa. Similarly,  geostationary satellites (those \\nthat circle the earth proximal to the equator once each day) yield high temporal resolution but low spatial \\nresolution, while sun-synchronous satellites (those that synchronize a near-polar orbit of the sensor with \\nthe sun\u2019s illumination) yield low temporal resolution while providing high spatial resolution. Although \\ntechnological advances can generally improve the various resolutions of an image, care must always be \\ntaken to ensure that the imagery you have chosen is adequate to the represent or model the geospatial \\nfeatures that are most important to your study. \\nAerial Photography \\nAerial photography, like satellite imagery, represents a vast source of information for use in any GIS. \\nPlatforms for the hardware used to take aerial photographs include airplanes, helicopters, balloons, \\nrockets, and so forth. While aerial photography connotes images taken of the visible spectrum, sensors to \\nmeasure bands within the nonvisible spectrum (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared, near -infrared) can also be fixed \\nto aerial sources. Similarly, aerial photography can be active or passive and can be taken from vert ical or \\noblique angles. Care must be taken with aerial photographs as the sensors used to take the images are \\nsimilar to cameras in their use of lenses. These lenses add a curvature to the images, which becomes more \\npronounced as one moves away from the center of the photo (Figure 4.15 \"Curvature Error Due to \\nLenticular Properties of Camera\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  99 \\nFigure 4.15 Curvature Error Due to Lenticular Properties of Camera \\n \\nAnother source of potential error in an aerial photograph is relief displacement. This error arises from the \\nthree-dimensional aspect of terrain features and is seen as apparent leaning away of vertical objects from \\nthe center point of an aerial photograph. To imagine this type of error, consider that a smokestack would \\nlook like a doughnut if the viewing camera was directly above the feature. However, if this same \\nsmokestack was observed near the edge of the camera\u2019s view, one could observe the sides of the \\nsmokestack. This error is frequently seen with trees and multistory buildings and worsens w ith \\nincreasingly taller features. \\nOrthophotos are vertical photographs that have been geometrically \u201ccorrected\u201d to remove the curvature \\nand terrain-induced error from images (Figure 4.16 \"Orthophoto\"). The most common orthophoto \\nproduct is the digital ortho quarter quadrangle (DOQQ). DOQQs are available through the US Geological \\nSurvey (USGS), who began producing these images from their library of 1:40,000- scale National Aerial \\nPhotography Program photos. These images can be obtained in either grayscale or color with 1-meter \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  100 \\nspatial resolution and 8-bit radiometric resolution. As the name suggests, these images cover a quarter of \\na USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, which equals an approximately 25 square mile area. Included with these \\nphotos is an additional 50 to 300-meter edge around the photo that allows users to mosaic many DOQQs \\ninto a single, continuous image. These DOQQs are ideal for use in a GIS as background display \\ninformation, for data editing, and for heads-up digitizing. \\nFigure 4.16 Orthophoto \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  101 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery is a common tool for GIS mapping applications as this data becomes increasingly \\navailable due to ongoing technological advances. \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery can be passive or active. \\n\u2022 The four types of resolution associated with satellite imagery are spatial, spectral, temporal, and \\nradiometric. \\n\u2022 Vertical and oblique aerial photographs provide valuable baseline informati on for GIS applications. \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to introduce different data types, measurement scales, and data capture \\nmethods. \\nAcquiring geographic data is an important factor in any geographic information system (GIS) effort. \\nIt has been estimated that data acquisition typically consumes 60 to 80 percent of the time and \\nmoney spent on any given project. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that GIS projects remain \\nmindful of their stated goals so the collection of spatial data proceeds in an efficient and effective \\nmanner as possible. This chapter outlines the many forms and sources of geospatial data available \\nfor use in a GIS. \\nData Types \\nThe type of data that we employ to help us understand a given entity is determined by (1) what we are \\nexamining, (2) what we want to know about that entity, and (3) our ability to measure that entity at a \\ndesired scale. The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, \\nnumbers, Boolean values, dates, and binaries. \\nAn alphanumeric string, or text, data type is any simple combination of letters and numbers that may or \\nmay not form coherent words. The number data type can be subcategorized as either floating-point or \\ninteger. A floating-point is any data value that contains decimal digits, while an integer is any data value \\nthat does not contain decimal digits. Integers can be short or long depending on the amount of significant \\ndigits in that number. Also, they are based on the concept of the \u201cbit\u201d in a computer. As you may recall, a \\nbit is the most basic unit of information in a computer and stores values in one of two states: 1 or 0. \\nTherefore, an 8-bit attribute would consist of eight 1s or 0s in any combination (e.g., 10010011, 00011011, \\n11100111). \\nShort integers are 16-bit values and therefore can be used to characterize numbers ranging either from \\n\u221232,768 to 32,767 or from 0 to 65,535 depending on whether the number is signed or unsigned (i.e., Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  104 \\ncontains a + or \u2212 sign).Long integers, alternatively, are 32-bit values and therefore can characterize \\nnumbers ranging either from \u22122,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or from 0 to 4,294,967,295.  \\nA single precision floating-point value occupies 32 bits, like the long integer. However, this data type \\nprovides for a value of up to 7 bits to the left of the decimal (a maxi mum value of 128, or 127 if signed) and \\nup to 23-bit values to the right of the decimal point (approximately 7 decimal digits). A \\ndouble precision floating-point value essentially stores two 32-bit values as a single value. Double \\nprecision floats, then, can represent a value with up to 11 bits to the left of the decimal point and values \\nwith up to 52 bits to the right of the decimal (approximately 16 decimal digits) ( Figure 5.1 \"Double \\nPrecision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer\"). \\nFigure 5.1 Double Precision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer \\n \\nBoolean, date, and binary values are less complex. Boolean values are simply those values that are deemed \\ntrue or false based on the application of a Boolean operator such  as AND, OR, and NOT. The date data \\ntype is presumably self-explanatory, while the binary data type represents attributes whose values are \\neither 1 or 0. \\nMeasurement Scale \\nIn addition to defining data by type, a measurement scale acts to group data accordi ng to level of \\ncomplexity (Stevens 1946). [1] For the purposes of GIS analyses, measurement scales can be grouped in to \\ntwo general categories. Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data; interval and ratio data \\nrepresent numeric data. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  105 \\nThe most simple data measurement scale is the nominal, or named, scale. The nominal scale makes \\nstatements about what to call data points but does not allow for scalar comparisons between one object \\nand another. For example, the attribution of nominal information to a set of points that represent cities \\nwill describe whether the given locale is \u201cLos Angeles\u201d or \u201cNew York.\u201d However, no further denotations, \\nsuch as population or voting history, can be made about those locales. Other examples of nominal data \\ninclude last name, eye color, land-use type, ethnicity, and gender. \\nOrdinal data places attribute information into ranks and therefore yields more precisely scaled \\ninformation than nominal data. Ordinal data describes the position in which data occur, such as first,  \\nsecond, third, and so forth. These scales may also take on names, such as \u201cvery unsatisfied,\u201d \u201cunsatisfied,\u201d \\n\u201csatisfied,\u201d and \u201cvery satisfied.\u201d Although this measurement scale indicates the ranking of each data point \\nrelative to other data points, the ordinal scale does not explicitly denote the exact quantitative difference \\nbetween these rankings. For example, if an ordinal attribute represents which runner came in first, \\nsecond, or third place, it does not state by how much time the winning runner beat the second place \\nrunner. Therefore, one cannot undertake arithmetic operations with ordinal data. Only sequence is \\nexplicit. \\nA measurement scale that does allow precise quantitative statements to be made about attributes \\nis interval data. Interval data are measured along a scale in which each position is equidistant to one \\nanother. Elevation and temperature readings are common representations of interval data. For example, \\nit can be determined through this scale that 30 \u00baF is 5 \u00baF warmer than 25 \u00baF. A notabl e property of the \\ninterval scale is that zero is not a meaningful value in the sense that zero does not represent nothingness, \\nor the absence of a value. Indeed, 0 \u00baF does not indicate that no temperature exists. Similarly, an \\nelevation of 0 feet does not indicate a lack of elevation; rather, it indicates mean sea level.  \\nRatio data are similar to the interval measurement scale; however, it is based around a meaningful zero \\nvalue. Population density is an example of ratio data whereby a 0 population density indicates that no \\npeople live in the area of interest. Similarly, the Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale as 0 K does imply \\nthat no heat (temperature) is measurable within the given attribute.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  106 \\nSpecific to numeric datasets, data values also can be considered to be discrete or \\ncontinuous. Discrete data are those that maintain a finite number of possible values, \\nwhile continuous data can be represented by an infinite number of values. For example, the number of \\nmature trees on a small property will necessarily be between one and one hundred (for argument\u2019s sake). \\nHowever, the height of those trees represents a continuous data value as there are an infinite number of \\npotential values (e.g., one tree may be 20 feet tall, 20.1 feet, or 20.15 feet, 20.157 fee t, and so forth). \\nPrimary Data Capture \\nNow that we have a sense of the different data types and measurement scales available for use in a GIS, we \\nmust direct our thoughts to how this data can be acquired. Primary data capture is a direct data \\nacquisition methodology that is usually associated with some type of in -the-field effort. In the case of \\nvector data, directly captured data commonly comes from a global positioning system (GPS) or other \\ntypes of surveying equipment such as a total station (Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station \\n(right)\"). Total stations are specialized, primary data capture instruments that combine a theodolite (or \\ntransit), which measures horizontal and vertical angles, with a tool to measure the slope distance from the \\nunit to an observed point. Use of a total station allows field crews to quickly and accurately derive the \\ntopography for a particular landscape. \\nFigure 5.2 GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right) \\n \\nIn the case of GPS, handheld units access positional data from satellites and log the information for \\nsubsequent retrieval. A network of twenty-four navigation satellites is situated around the globe and \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  107 \\nprovides precise coordinate information for any point on the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 5.3 \"Earth Imaging \\nSatellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Maintaining a line of sight to four or more of these satellites provides \\nthe user with reasonably accurate location information. These locations can be collected as individual \\npoints or can be linked together to form lines or polygons depending on user preference. Attribute data \\nsuch as land-use type, telephone pole number, and river name can be simultaneously entered by the user. \\nThis location and attribute data can then be uploaded to the GIS for visualization. Depending on the G PS \\nmake and model, this upload often requires some type of intermediate file conversion via software \\nprovided by the manufacturer of the GPS unit. However, there are some free online resources that can \\nconvert GPS data from one format to another. GPSBabel is an example of such an online resource \\n(http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/gpsbabel). \\nIn addition to the typical GPS unit shown in Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right)\", GPS is \\nbecoming increasingly incorporated into other new technologies. For example, smartphones now embed \\nGPS capabilities as a standard technological component. These phone/GPS units maintain comparable \\naccuracy to similarly priced stand-alone GPS units and are largely responsible for a renaissance in \\nfacilitating portable, real-time data capture and sharing to the masses. The ubiquity of this technology led \\nto a proliferation of crowdsourced data acquisition alternatives. Crowdsourcing is a data collection \\nmethod whereby users contribute freely to building spatial databases. This rapidly expanding \\nmethodology is utilized in such applications as TomTom\u2019s MapShare application, Google Earth, Bing \\nMaps, and ArcGIS. \\nRaster data obtained via direct capture comes more commonly from remotely sensed sources ( Figure 5.3 \\n\"Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Remotely sensed data offers the advantage of \\nobviating the need for physical access to the area being imaged. In addition, huge tracts of land can be \\ncharacterized with little to no additional time and labor by the researcher. On the other hand, validation is \\nrequired for remotely sensed data to ensure that the sensor is not only operating correctly but properly \\ncalibrated to collect the desired information. Satellites and aerial cameras provide the most ubiquitous \\nsources of direct-capture raster data (Chapter 4 \"Data Models for GIS\", Section 4.3.1 \"Satellite Imagery\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  108 \\nFigure 5.3 Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data \\n \\nSecondary Data Capture \\nSecondary data capture is an indirect methodology that utilizes the vast amount of existing geospatial data \\navailable in both digital and hard-copy formats. Prior to initiating any GIS effort, it is always wise to mine \\nonline resources for existing GIS data that may fulfill your mapping needs without the potentially \\nintensive step of creating the data from scratch. Such digital GIS data are available from a variety of \\nsources including international agencies (CGIAR, CIESIN, United Nations, World Bank, etc.) ; federal \\ngovernments (USGS, USDA, NOAA, USFWS, NASA, EPA, US Census, etc.); state governments (CDFG, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  109 \\nTeale Data Center, INGIS, MARIS, NH GIS Resources, etc.); local governments (SANDAG, RCLIS, etc.); \\nuniversity websites (UCLA, Duke, Stanford, University of Chicago, Indiana Spatial Data Portal, etc.); and \\ncommercial websites (ESRI, GeoEye, Geocomm, etc.). These secondary data are available in a wide \\nassortment of file types, extents, and sizes but is ready-made to be used in most GIS software packages. \\nOften these data are free, but many sites will charge a fee for access to the proprietary information they \\nhave developed. \\nAlthough these data sources are all cases where the information has been converted to digital format and \\nproperly projected for use in a GIS, there is also a great deal of spatial information that can be gleaned \\nfrom existing, nondigital sources. Paper maps, for example, may contain current or historic information \\non a locale that cannot be found in digital format. In this case, the process  of digitization can be used to \\ncreate digital files from the original paper copy. Three primary methods exist for digitizing spatial \\ninformation: two are manual, and one is automated. \\nTablet digitizing is a manual data capture method whereby a user enters coordinate information into a \\ncomputer through the use of a digitizing tablet and a digitizing puck. To begin, a paper map is secured to a \\nback-lit digitizing tablet. The backlight allows all features on the map to be easily observed, which reduces \\neyestrain. The coordinates of the point, line, and/or polygon features on the paper map are then entered \\ninto a digital file as the user employs a puck, which is similar to a multibutton mouse with a crosshair, to \\n\u201cclick\u201d their way around the vertices of each desired feature. The resulting digital file will need to be \\nproperly georeferenced following completion of the digitization task to ensure that this information will \\nproperly align with existing datasets. \\nHeads-up digitizing, the second manual data capture method, is referred to as \u201con-screen\u201d digitizing. \\nHeads-up digitizing can be used on either paper maps or existing digital files. In the case of a paper map, \\nthe map must first be scanned into the computer at a high enough resolution that will allow all per tinent \\nfeatures to be resolved. Second, the now-digital image must be registered so the map will conform to an \\nexisting coordinate system. To do this, the user can enter control points on the screen and transform, or \\n\u201crubber-sheet,\u201d the scanned image into real world coordinates. Finally, the user simply zooms to specific \\nareas on the map and traces the points, lines, and/or polygons, similar to the tablet digitization example. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  110 \\nHeads-up digitizing is particularly simple when existing GIS files, satellite ima ges, or aerial photographs \\nare used as a baseline. For example, if a user plans to digitize the boundary of a lake as seen from a \\ngeoreferenced satellite image, the steps of scanning and registering can be skipped, and projection \\ninformation from the originating image can simply be copied over to the digitized file. \\nThe third, automated method of secondary data capture requires the user to scan a paper map and \\nvectorize the information therein. This vectorization method typically requires a specific software package \\nthat can convert a raster scan to vector lines. This requires a very high-resolution, clean scan. If the image \\nis not clean, all the imperfections on the map will likely be converted to false points/lines/polygons in the \\ndigital version. If a clean scan is not available, it is often faster to use a manual digitization methodology. \\nRegardless, this method is much quicker than the aforementioned manual methods and may be the best \\noption if multiple maps must be digitized and/or if time is a limiting factor. Often, a semiautomatic \\napproach is employed whereby a map is scanned and vectorized, followed by a heads- up digitizing session \\nto edit and repair any errors that occurred during automation. \\nThe final secondary data capture method worth noting is the use of information from  reports and \\ndocuments. Via this method, one enters information from reports and documents into the attribute \\ntable of an existing, digital GIS file that contains all the pertinent points, lines, and polygons. For example, \\nnew information specific to census tracts may become available following a scientific study. The GIS user \\nsimply needs to download the existing GIS file of census tracts and begin entering the study\u2019s \\nreport/document information directly into the attribute table. If the data tables are available digitally, the \\nuse of the \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201crelate\u201d functions in a GIS (Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\") are often extremely \\nhelpful as they will automate much of the data entry effort. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, numbers, Boolean \\nvalues, dates, and binaries. \\n\u2022 Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data, while interval and ratio data represent numeric \\ndata. \\n\u2022 Data capture methodologies are derived from either primary or secondary sources. \\n Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  111 \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand the basic properties of a relational database management \\nsystem. \\nA database is a structured collection of data files. A database management system (DBMS) is a software \\npackage that allows for the creation, storage, maintenance, manipulation, and retrieval of large \\ndatasets that are distributed over one or more files. A DBMS and its associated functions are usually \\naccessed through commercial software packages such as Microsoft Access, Oracle, FileMaker Pro, or \\nAvanquest MyDataBase. Database management normally refers to the management of tabular data \\nin row and column format and is frequently used for personal, business, government, and scientific \\nendeavors. Geospatial database management systems, alternatively, include the functionality of a \\nDBMS but also contain specific geographic information about each data point such as identity, \\nlocation, shape, and orientation. Integrating this geographic information with the tabular attribute \\ndata of a classical DBMS provide users with powerful tools to visualize and answer the spatially \\nexplicit questions that arise in an increasingly technological society. \\nSeveral types of database models exist, such as the flat, hierarchical, network, and relational models \\n(Worboys 1995; Jackson 1999). [1], [2] A flat database is essentially a spreadsheet whereby all data are \\nstored in a single, large table (Figure 5.4 \"Flat Database\"). A hierarchical database is also a fairly \\nsimple model that organizes data into a \u201cone-to-many\u201d association across levels (Figure 5.5 \\n\"Hierarchical Database\"). Common examples of this model include phylogenetic trees for \\nclassification of plants and animals and familial genealogical trees showing parent-child \\nrelationships. Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases, however, because they also \\nsupport \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationships (Figure 5.6 \"Network Database\"). This expanded capability \\nallows greater search flexibility within the dataset and reduces potential redundancy of information. \\nAlternatively, both the hierarchical and network models can become incredibly complex depending \\non the size of the databases and the number of interactions between the data points. Modern Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  113 \\ngeographic information system (GIS) software typically employs a fourth model referred to as \\na relational database (Codd 1970). [3] \\nFigure 5.4 Flat Database \\n \\nFigure 5.5 Hierarchical Database \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  114 \\nFigure 5.6 Network Database \\n \\nRelational Database Management Systems \\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of tables that are connected in such a \\nway that that data can be accessed without reorganization of the tables. The tables are created such that \\neach column represents a particular attribute (e.g., soil type, PIN number, last name, acreage) and each \\nrow contains a unique instance of data for that columnar attribute (e.g., Delhi Sands Soils, 5555, Smith, \\n412.3 acres) \\nIn the relational model, each table (not surprisingly called a relation) is linked to each other table via \\npredetermined keys (Date 1995). [4] The primary key represents the attribute (column) whose value \\nuniquely identifies a particular record (row) in the relation (table). The primary key may not contain \\nmissing values as multiple missing values would represent nonunique entities that violate the basic rule of \\nthe primary key. The primary key corresponds to an identical attribute in a secondary table (and possibly \\nthird, fourth, fifth, etc.) called a foreign key. This results in all the information in the first table being \\ndirectly related to the information in the second table via the primary and foreign keys, hence the term \\n\u201crelational\u201d DBMS. With these links in place, tables within the database can be kept very simple, resulting \\nin minimal computation time and file complexity. This process can be repeated over many tables as long \\nas each contains a foreign key that corresponds to another table\u2019s primary key. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  115 \\nThe relational model has two primary advantages over the other database models described earlier. First, \\neach table can now be separately prepared, maintained, and edited. This is particularly useful when one \\nconsiders the potentially huge size of many of today\u2019s modern databases. Second, the tables may be \\nmaintained separately until the need for a particular query or analysis calls for the tables to be related. \\nThis creates a large degree of efficiency for processing of information within a given database.  \\nIt may become apparent to the reader that there is great potential for redundancy in this model as each \\ntable must contain an attribute that corresponds to an attribute in every other related table. Therefore, \\nredundancy must actively be monitored and managed in a RDBMS. To accomplish this, a set of rules \\ncalled normal forms have been developed (Codd 1970). [5] There are three basic normal forms. \\nThe first normal form (Figure 5.7 \"First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below)\") refers to five \\nconditions that must be met (Date 1995). [6] They are as follows: \\n1. There is no sequence to the ordering of the rows. \\n2. There is no sequence to the ordering of the columns. \\n3. Each row is unique. \\n4. Every cell contains one and only one value. \\n5. All values in a column pertain to the same subject. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  116 \\nFigure 5.7 First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe second normal form states that any column that is not a primary key must be dependent on the \\nprimary key. This reduces redundancy by eliminating the potential for mult iple primary keys throughout \\nmultiple tables. This step often involves the creation of new tables to maintain normalization.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  117 \\nFigure 5.8 Second Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe third normal form states that all nonprimary keys must depend on the primary key, while the primary \\nkey remains independent of all nonprimary keys. This form was wittily summed up by Kent (1983)  [7] who \\nquipped that all nonprimary keys \u201cmust provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the \\nkey.\u201d Echoing this quote is the rejoinder: \u201cso help me Codd\u201d (personal communication with Foresman \\n1989). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  118 \\nFigure 5.9 Third Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nJoins and Relates \\nAn additional advantage of an RDBMS is that it allows attribute data in separate tables to be linked in a \\npost hoc fashion. The two operations commonly used to accomplish this are the join and relate. \\nThe join operation appends the fields of one table into a second table through the use of an attribute or \\nfield that is common to both tables. This is commonly utilized to combine attribute information from one \\nor more nonspatial data tables (i.e., information taken from reports or documents) with a spatially explicit \\nGIS feature layer. A second type of join combines feature information based on spatial location and \\nassociation rather than on common attributes. In ArcGIS, three types of spatial joins are available. Users \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  119 \\nmay (1) match each feature to the closest feature, (2) match each feature to the feature that it is part of, or \\n(3) match each feature to the feature that it intersects. \\nAlternatively, the relate operation temporarily associates two map layers or tables while keeping them \\nphysically separate. Relates are bidirectional, so data can be accessed from the one of the tables by \\nselecting records in the other table. The relate operation also allows for the association of three or more \\ntables, if necessary. \\nSometimes it can be unclear as to which operation one should use. As a general rule, joins are most \\nsuitable for instances involving one-to-one or many-to-one relationships. Joins are also advantageous due \\nto the fact that the data from the two tables are readily observable in the single output table . The use of \\nrelates, on the other hand, are suitable for all table relationships (one -to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, \\nand many-to-many); however, they can slow down computer access time if the tables are particularly \\nlarge or spread out over remote locations. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Database management systems can be flat, hierarchical, network, or relational.  \\n\u2022 Relational database management systems (RDBMS) utilize primary keys and foreign keys to link data \\ntables. \\n\u2022 The RDBMS model reduces data redundancy by employing three basic \u201cnormal forms.\u201d  \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to overview a sample of the most common types of vector, raster, and \\nhybrid file formats. \\nGeospatial data are stored in many different file formats. Each geographic information system (GIS) \\nsoftware package, and each version of these software packages, supports different formats. This is \\ntrue for both vector and raster data. Although several of the more common file formats are \\nsummarized here, many other formats exist for use in various GIS programs. \\nVector File Formats \\nThe most common vector file format is the shapefile. Shapefiles, developed by ESRI in the early 1990s for \\nuse with the dBASE III database management software package in ArcView 2, are simple, nontopological \\nfiles developed to store the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. \\nShapefiles are incapable of storing null values, as well as annotations or network features. Field names \\nwithin the attribute table are limited to ten characters, and each shapefile can represent only point, line, \\nor polygon feature sets. Supported data types are limited to floating point, integer, date, and text. \\nShapefiles are supported by almost all commercial and open-source GIS software. \\nDespite being called a \u201cshapefile,\u201d this format is actually a compilation of many different files. Table 5.1 \\n\"Shapefile File Types\" lists and describes the different file formats associated with the shapefile. Among \\nthose listed, only the SHP, SHX, and DBF file formats are mandatory to create a functioning shapefile, \\nwhile all others are conditionally required. As a general rule, the names for each file should conform to the \\nMS-DOS 8.3 convention when using older versions of GIS software packages. According to this \\nconvention, the filename prefix can contain up to eight characters, and the filename suffix contains three \\ncharacters. The more recent GIS software packages have relaxed this requirement and will accept longer \\nfilename prefixes. \\nTable 5.1 Shapefile File Types Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  122 \\nFile Extension Purpose \\nSHP* Feature geometry \\nSHX* Index format for the feature geometry \\nDBF* Feature attribute information in dBASE IV format \\nPRJ Projection information \\nSBN and SBX Spatial index of the features \\nFBN and FBX Read-only spatial index of the features \\nAIN and AIH Attribute information for active fields in the table \\nIXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles \\nMXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles with ODB format \\nATX Attribute index used in ArcGIS 8 and later \\nSHP.XML Metadata in XML format \\nCPG Code page specifications for identifying character encoding \\n* Indicates mandatory files \\nThe earliest vector format file for use in GIS software packages, which is still in use today, is the \\nArcInfo coverage. This georelational file format supports multiple features types (e.g., points, lines, \\npolygons, annotations) while also storing the topological information associated with those features. \\nAttribute data are stored as multiple files in a separate directory labeled \u201cInfo.\u201d Due to its creation in an \\nMS-DOS environment, these files maintain strict naming conventions. File names cannot be longer than \\nthirteen characters, cannot contain spaces, cannot start with a number, and must be completely in \\nlowercase. Coverages cannot be edited in ArcGIS 9.x or later versions of ESRI\u2019s software package. \\nThe US Census Bureau maintains a specific type of shapefile referred to as TIGER \\norTIGER/Line (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system). Although these \\nopen-source files do not contain actual census information, they map features such as census tracts, \\nroads, railroads, buildings, rivers, and other features that support and improve the bureau and improve \\nthe Bureau\u2019s ability to#8217;s ability to collect census information. TIGER/Line shapefiles, first released \\nin 1990, are topologically explicit and are linked to the Census Bureau\u2019s Master Address File (MAF), Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  123 \\ntherefore enabling the geocoding of street addresses. These files are free to the public and can be freely \\ndownloaded from private vendors that support the format. \\nTheAutoCAD DXF (Drawing Interchange Format or Drawing Exchange Format)is a proprietary vector file \\nformat developed by Autodesk to allow interchange between engineering -based CAD (computer-aided \\ndesign) software and other mapping software packages. DXF files were originally released in 1982 with \\nthe purpose of providing an exact representation of AutoCAD\u2019s native DWG format. Although the DXF is \\nstill commonly used, newer versions of AutoCAD have incorporated more complex data types (e.g., \\nregions, dynamic blocks) that are not supported in the DXF format. Therefore, it may be presumed that \\nthe DXF format may become less popular in geospatial analysis over time.  \\nFinally, the US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains an open-source vector file format that details \\nphysical and cultural features across the United States. These topologically \\nexplicit DLGs (Digital Line Graphics) come in large-, intermediate-, and small-scale depending on \\nwhether they are derived from 1:24,000-; 1:100,000-; or 1:2,000,000-scale USGS topographic \\nquadrangle maps. The features available in the different DLG types depend on the scale of the DLG but \\ngenerally include data such as administrative and political boundaries, hydrography, transportation \\nsystems, hypsography, and land cover. \\nVector data files can also be structured to represent surface elevation information. \\nA TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) is an open-source vector data structure that uses contiguous, \\nnonoverlapping triangles to represent geographic surfaces (Figure 5.10 \"Triangulated Irregular Network \\n(TIN)\"). Whereas the raster depiction of a surface represents elevation as an average value over the spatial \\nextent of the individual pixel (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster File Formats\"), the TIN data structure models \\neach vertex of the triangle as an exact elevation value at a specific po int on the earth. The arcs between \\neach vertex are an approximation of the elevation between two vertices. These arcs are then aggregated \\ninto triangles from which information on elevation, slope, aspect, and surface area can be derived across \\nthe entire extent of the model\u2019s space. Note that term \u201cirregular\u201d in the name of the data model refers to \\nthe fact that the vertices are typically laid out in a scattered fashion.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  124 \\nFigure 5.10 Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) \\n \\nThe use of TINs confers certain advantages over raster-based elevation models (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster \\nFile Formats\"). First, linear topographic features are very accurately represented relative to their raster \\ncounterpart. Second, a comparatively small number of data points are needed  to represent a surface, so \\nfile sizes are typically much smaller. This is particularly true as vertices can be clustered in areas where \\nrelief is complex and can be sparse in areas where relief is simple. Third, specific elevation data can be \\nincorporated into the data model in a post hoc fashion via the placement of additional vertices if the \\noriginal is deemed insufficient or inadequate. Finally, certain spatial statistics can be calculated that \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  125 \\ncannot be obtained when using a raster-based elevation model, such as flood plain delineation, storage \\ncapacity curves for reservoirs, and time-area curves for hydrographs. \\nRaster File Formats \\nA multitude of raster file format types are available for use in GIS. The selection of raster formats has \\ndramatically increased with the widespread availability of imagery from digital cameras, video recorders, \\nsatellites, and so forth. Raster imagery is typically 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit (16 million colors). Due to \\nongoing technological advancements, raster image file sizes have been getting larger and larger. To deal \\nwith this potential constraint, two types of file compression are commonly used: lossless and \\nlossy. Lossless compression reduces file size without decreasing image quality.  Lossy compression \\nattempts to exploit limitations of the human eye by removing information from the image that cannot be \\nsensed. As you may guess, lossy compression results in smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  \\nAmong the most common raster files used on the web are the JPEG, T IFF, and PNG formats, all of which \\nare open source and can be used with most GIS software packages. \\nThe JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) andTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) raster formats are \\nmost frequently used by digital cameras to store 8-bit values for each of the red, blue, and green colors \\nspaces (and sometimes 16-bit colors, in the case of TIFF images). JPEGs support lossy compression, while \\nTIFFs can be either lossy or lossless. Unlike JPEG, TIFF images can be saved in either RGB or CMYK \\ncolor spaces.PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are 24-bit images that support either lossy or lossless \\ncompression. PNG files are designed for efficient viewing in web-based browsers such as Internet \\nExplorer, Mozilla Firefox, Netscape, and Safari. \\nNative JPEG, TIFF, and PNG files do not have georeferenced information associated with them and \\ntherefore cannot be used in any geospatial mapping efforts. In order to employ these files in a GIS, \\na world file must first be created. A world file is a separate, plaintext data file that specifies the locations \\nand transformations that allow the image to be projected into a standard coordinate system (e.g., \\nUniversal Transverse Mercator [UTM] or State Plane). The filename of the world file is based on the name \\nof the raster file, while a w is typically added into to the file extension. The world file extension name for a \\nJPEG is JPW; for a TIFF, it is TFW; and for a PNG, PGW. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  126 \\nAn example of a raster file format with explicit georeferencing information is the \\nproprietary MrSID (Multiresolution Seamless Image Database) format. This lossless compression format \\nwas developed by LizardTech, Inc., for use with large aerial photographs or satellite images, whereby \\nportions of a compressed image can be viewed quickly without having to decompress the entire file. The \\nMrSID format is frequently used for visualizing orthophotos. \\nLike MrSID, the proprietary ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) format also includes georeferencing \\ninformation within the file structure. This lossy compression format was developed by Earth Resource \\nMapping and supports up to 255 layers of image information. Due to the potentially huge file sizes \\nassociated with an image that supports so many layers, ECW files represent an excellent option for \\nperforming rapid analysis on large images while using a relatively small amount of the computer\u2019s RAM \\n(Random Access Memory), thus accelerating computation speed. \\nLike the open-source, vector-based DLG, DRGs (Digital Raster Graphics)are scanned versions of USGS \\ntopographic maps and include all of the collar material from the originals. The geospatial information \\nfound within the image\u2019s neatline is georeferenced, specifically to the UTM coordinate system. These \\ngraphics are scanned at a minimum of 250 dpi (dots per inch) and therefore have a spatial resolution of \\napproximately 2.4 meters. DRGs contain up to thirteen colors and therefore may look slightly different \\nfrom the originals. In addition, they include all the collar material from the original print vers ion, are \\ngeoreferenced to the surface of the earth, fit the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, and are \\nmost likely based on the NAD27 data points (NAD stands for North American Datum).  \\nLike the TIN vector format, some raster file formats are developed explicitly for modeling elevation. These \\ninclude the USGS DEM, USGS SDTS, and DTED file formats.  \\nTheUSGS DEM (US Geological Survey Digital Elevation Model) is a popular file format due to widespread \\navailability, the simplicity of the model, and the extensive software support for the format. Each pixel \\nvalue in these grid-based DEMs denotes spot elevations on the ground, usually in feet or meters. Care \\nmust be taken when using grid-based DEMs due to the enormous volume of data that accompanies the se \\nfiles as the spatial extent covered in the image begins to increase. DEMs are referred to \\nas digital terrain models (DTMs) when they represent a simple, bare-earth model and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  127 \\nas digital surface models (DSMs)when they include the heights of landscape features such as buildings \\nand trees (Figure 5.11 \"Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right)\" ). \\nFigure 5.11 Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right) \\n \\nUSGS DEMs can be classified into one of four levels of quality (labeled 1 to 4) depending on its source \\ndata and resolution. This source data can be 1:24,000-; 1:63,360-; or 1:250,000-scale topographic \\nquadrangles. The DEM format is a single file of ASCII text comprised of three data blocks; A, B, and C. \\nThe A block contains header information such as data origin, type, and measurement systems. The B \\nblock contains contiguous elevation data described as a six-character integer. The C block contains trailer \\ninformation such as root-mean square (RMS) error of the scene. The USGS DEM format has recently been \\nsucceeded by the USGS SDTS (Spatial Data Transfer Standard) DEMformat. The SDTS format [1] was \\nspecifically developed as a distribution format for transferring data from one computer to another with \\nzero data loss. \\nThe DTED (Digital Terrain Elevation Data) format is another elevation specific raster file format. It was \\ndeveloped in the 1970s for military purposes such as line of sight analysis, 3- D visualization, and mission \\nplanning. The DTED format maintains three levels of data over five different latitudinal zones. Level 0 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  128 \\ndata has a resolution of approximately 900 meters; Level 1 data has a resolution of approximately 90 \\nmeters; and Level 2 data has a resolution of approximately 30 meters.  \\nHybrid File Formats \\nA geodatabase is a recently developed, proprietary ESRI file format that supports both vector and raster \\nfeature datasets (e.g., points, lines, polygons, annotation, JPEG, TIFF) within a single file.  This format \\nmaintains topological relationships and is stored as an MDB file. The geodatabase was developed to be a \\ncomprehensive model for representing and modeling geospatial information.  \\nThere are three different types of geodatabases. The personal geodatabase was developed for single-user \\nediting, whereby two editors cannot work on the same geodatabase at a given time. The personal \\ngeodatabase employs the Microsoft Access DBMS file format and maintains a size limit of 2 gigabytes per \\nfile, although it has been noted that performance begins to degrade after file size approaches 250 \\nmegabytes. The personal geodatabase is currently being phased out by ESRI and is therefore not used for \\nnew data creation. \\nThe file geodatabase similarly allows only single-user editing, but this restriction applies only to unique \\nfeature datasets within a geodatabase. The file geodatabase incorporates new tools such as domains (rules \\napplied to attributes), subtypes (groups of objects with a feature class or table), and split/ merge policies \\n(rules to control and define the output of split and merge operations). This format stores information as \\nbinary files with a size limit of 1 terabyte and has been noted to perform and scale much more efficiently \\nthan the personal geodatabase (approximately one-third of the feature geometry storage required by \\nshapefiles and personal geodatabases). File databases are not tied to any specific relational database \\nmanagement system and can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. Finally,  file \\ngeodatabases can be compressed to read-only formats that further reduce file size without subsequently \\nreducing performance. \\nThe third hybrid ESRI format is the ArcSDE geodatabase, which allows multiple editors to simultaneously \\nwork on feature datasets within a single geodatabase (a.k.a. versioning). Like the file geodatabase, this \\nformat can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. File size is limited to 4 gigabytes and its Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  129 \\nproprietary nature requires an ArcInfo or ArcEditor license for use. The ArcSDE geodatabase is \\nimplemented on the SQL Server Express software package, which is a free DBMS platform developed by \\nMicrosoft. \\nIn addition to the geodatabase, Adobe Systems Incorporated\u2019s \\ngeospatial PDF (Portable Document Format) is an open-source format that allows for the representation \\nof geometric entities such as points, lines, and polygons. Geospatial PDFs can be used to find and mark \\ncoordinate pairs, measure distances, reproject files, and georegister raster images. This format is \\nparticularly useful as the PDF is widely accepted to be the preferred standard for printable web \\ndocuments. Although functionally similar, the geospatial PDF should not be confused with the GeoPDF \\nformat developed by TerraGo Technologies. Rather, the GeoPDF is a b randed version of the geospatial \\nPDF. \\nFinally, Google Earth supports a new, open-source, hybrid file format referred to as \\na KML (Keyhole Markup Language). KML files associate points, lines, polygons, images, 3-D models, and \\nso forth, with a longitude and latitude value, as well as other view information such as tilt, heading, \\naltitude, and so forth. KMZ files are commonly encountered, and they are zipped versions KML files.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Common vector file formats used in geospatial applications include shapefiles, coverages, TIGER/Lines, \\nAutoCAD DXFs, and DLGs. \\n\u2022 Common raster file formats used in geospatial applications include JPGs, TIFFs, PNGs, MrSIDs, ECWs, \\nDRGs, USGS DEMs, and DTEDs. \\n\u2022 Common hybrid file formats used in geospatial applications include geodatabases (personal, file, and \\nArcSDE) and geospatial PDFs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to ascertain the different types of error inherent in geospatial datasets.  \\nNot all geospatial data are created equally. Data quality refers to the ability of a given dataset to \\nsatisfy the objective for which it was created. With the voluminous amounts of geospatial data being \\ncreated and served to the cartographic community, care must be taken by individual geographic \\ninformation system (GIS) users to ensure that the data employed for their project is suitable for the \\ntask at hand. \\nTwo primary attributes characterize data quality. Accuracy describes how close a measurement is to \\nits actual value and is often expressed as a probability (e.g., 80 percent of all points are within +/\u2212 5 \\nmeters of their true locations). Precision refers to the variance of a value when repeated \\nmeasurements are taken. A watch may be correct to 1/1000th of a second (precise) but may be 30 \\nminutes slow (not accurate). As you can see in Figure 5.12 \"Accuracy and Precision\", the blue darts \\nare both precise and accurate, while the red darts are precise but inaccurate. \\nFigure 5.12 Accuracy and Precision \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  131 \\nSeveral types of error can arise when accuracy and/or precision requirements are not met during \\ndata capture and creation. Positional accuracy is the probability of a feature being within +/\u2212 units of \\neither its true location on earth (absolute positional accuracy) or its location in relation to other \\nmapped features (relative positional accuracy). For example, it could be said that a particular \\nmapping effort may result in 95 percent of trees being mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet for their true \\nlocation (absolute), or 95 percent of trees are mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet of their location as \\nobserved on a digital ortho quarter quadrangle (relative). \\nSpeaking about absolute positional error does beg the question, however, of what exactly is the true \\nlocation of an object? As discussed in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", differing conceptions of the earth\u2019s \\nshape has led to a plethora of projections, data points, and spheroids, each attempting to clarify \\npositional errors for particular locations on the earth. To begin addressing this unanswerable \\nquestion, the US National Map Accuracy Standard (or NMAS) suggests that to meet horizontal \\naccuracy requirements, a paper map is expected to have no more than 10 percent of measurable \\npoints fall outside the accuracy values range shown in Figure 5.13 \"Relation between Positional Error \\nand Scale\". Similarly, the vertical accuracy of no more than 10 percent of elevations on a contour \\nmap shall be in error of more than one-half the contour interval. Any map that does not meet these \\nhorizontal and vertical accuracy standards will be deemed unacceptable for publication. \\nFigure 5.13 Relation between Positional Error and Scale \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  132 \\nPositional errors arise via multiple sources. The process of digitizing paper maps commonly \\nintroduces such inaccuracies. Errors can arise while registering the map on the digitizing board. A \\npaper map can shrink, stretch, or tear over time, changing the dimensions of the scene. Input errors \\ncreated from hastily digitized points are common. Finally, converting between coordinate systems \\nand transforming between data points may also introduce errors to the dataset. \\nThe root-mean square (RMS) error is frequently used to evaluate the degree of inaccuracy in a \\ndigitized map. This statistic measures the deviation between the actual (true) and estimated \\n(digitized) locations of the control points. Figure 5.14 \"Potential Digitization Error\" illustrates the \\ninaccuracies of lines representing soil types that result from input control point location errors. By \\napplying an RMS error calculation to the dataset, one could determine the accuracy of the digitized \\nmap and thus determine its suitability for inclusion in a given study. \\nFigure 5.14 Potential Digitization Error \\n \\nPositional errors can also arise when features to be mapped are inherently vague. Take the example \\nof a wetland (Figure 5.15 \"Defining a Wetland Boundary\"). What defines a wetland boundary? \\nWetlands are determined by a combination of hydrologic, vegetative, and edaphic factors. Although \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers is currently responsible for defining the boundary of wetlands \\nthroughout the country, this task is not as simple as it may seem. In particular, regional differences \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  133 \\nin the characteristics of a wetland make delineating these features particularly troublesome. For \\nexample, the definition of a wetland boundary for the riverine wetlands in the eastern United States, \\nwhere water is abundant, is often useless when delineating similar types of wetlands in the desert \\nsouthwest United States. Indeed, the complexity and confusion associated with the conception of \\nwhat a \u201cwetland\u201d is may result in difficulties defining the feature in the field, which subsequently \\nleads to positional accuracy errors in the GIS database. \\nFigure 5.15 Defining a Wetland Boundary \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  134 \\nIn addition to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy is a common source of error in a GIS. Attribute \\nerrors can occur when an incorrect value is recorded within the attribute field or when a field is \\nmissing a value. Misspelled words and other typographical errors are common as well. Similarly, a \\ncommon inaccuracy occurs when developers enter \u201c0\u201d in an attribute field when the value is actually \\n\u201cnull.\u201d This is common in count data where \u201c0\u201d would represent zero findings, while a \u201cnull\u201d would \\nrepresent a locale where no data collection effort was undertaken. In the case of categorical values, \\ninaccuracies occasionally occur when attributes are mislabeled. For example, a land-use/land-cover \\nmap may list a polygon as \u201cagricultural\u201d when it is, in fact, \u201cresidential.\u201d This is particularly true if \\nthe dataset is out of date, which leads us to our next source of error. \\nTemporal accuracy addresses the age or timeliness of a dataset. No dataset is ever completely current. \\nIn the time it takes to create the dataset, it has already become outdated. Regardless, there are \\nseveral dates to be aware of while using a dataset. These dates should be found within the metadata. \\nThe publication date will tell you when the dataset was created and/or released. The field date relates \\nthe date and time the data was collected. If the dataset contains any future prediction, there should \\nalso be a forecast period and/or date. To address temporal accuracy, many datasets undergo a \\nregular data update regimen. For example, the California Department of Fish and Game updates its \\nsensitive species databases on a near monthly basis as new findings are continually being made. It is \\nimportant to ensure that, as an end-user, you are constantly using the most up-to-date data for your \\nGIS application. \\nThe fourth type of accuracy in a GIS is logical consistency. Logical consistency requires that the data \\nare topologically correct. For example, does a stream segment of a line shapefile fall within the \\nfloodplain of the corresponding polygon shapefile? Do roadways connect at nodes? Do all the \\nconnections and flows point in the correct direction in a network? In regards to the last question, the \\nauthor was recently using an unnamed smartphone application to navigate a busy city roadway and \\nwas twice told to turn the wrong direction down one-way streets. So beware, errors in logical \\nconsistency may lead to traffic violations, or worse! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  135 \\nThe final type of accuracy is data completeness. Comprehensive inclusion of all features within the \\nGIS database is required to ensure accurate mapping results. Simply put, all the data must be present \\nfor a dataset to be accurate. Are all of the counties in the state represented? Are all of the stream \\nsegments included in the river network? Is every convenience store listed in the database? Are only \\ncertain types of convenience stores listed within the database? Indeed, incomplete data will \\ninevitably lead to incomplete or insufficient analysis. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 All geospatial data contains error. \\n\u2022 Accuracy represents how close a measurement is to its actual value, while precision refers to the variance \\nof a value when repeated measurements are taken. \\n\u2022 The five types of error in a geospatial dataset are related to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, \\ntemporal accuracy, logical consistency, and data completeness. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the five types of accuracy/precision errors associated geographic information? Provide an \\nexample of each type of error. \\n2. Per the description of the positional accuracy of wetland boundaries, discuss a map feature whose \\nboundaries are inherently vague and difficult to map. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  136 \\nChapter 6 \\n \\nData Characteristics and Visualization \\nIn previous chapters, we learned how geographic information system (GIS) software packages use \\ndatabases to store extensive attribute information for geospatial features within a map. The true \\nusefulness of this information, however, is not realized until similarly powerful analytical tools are \\nemployed to access, process, and simplify the data. To accomplish this, GIS typically provides \\nextensive tools for searching, querying, describing, summarizing, and classifying datasets. With these \\ndata exploration tools, even the most expansive datasets can be mined to provide users the ability to \\nmake meaningful insights into and statements about that information. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  137 \\n6.1 Descriptions and Summaries \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review the most frequently used measures of distribution, central \\ntendency, and dispersion. \\nNo discussion of geospatial analysis would be complete without a brief overview of basic statistical \\nconcepts. The basic statistics outlined here represent a starting point for any attempt to describe, \\nsummarize, and analyze geospatial datasets. An example of a common geospatial statistical endeavor \\nis the analysis of point data obtained by a series of rainfall gauges patterned throughout a particular \\nregion. Given these rain gauges, one could determine the typical amount and variability of rainfall at \\neach station, as well as typical rainfall throughout the region as a whole. In addition, you could \\ninterpolate the amount of rainfall that falls between each station or the location where the most (or \\nleast) rainfall occurs. Furthermore, you could predict the expected amount of rainfall into the future \\nat each station, between each station, or within the region as a whole. \\nThe increase of computational power over the past few decades has given rise to vast datasets that \\ncannot be summarized easily. Descriptive statistics provide simple numeric descriptions of these large \\ndatasets. Descriptive statistics tend to be univariate analyses, meaning they examine one variable at a \\ntime. There are three families of descriptive statistics that we will discuss here: measures of \\ndistribution, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion. However, before we delve \\ntoo deeply into various statistical techniques, we must first define a few terms. \\n\u2022 Variable: a symbol used to represent any given value or set of values  \\n\u2022 Value: an individual observation of a variable (in a geographic information system [GIS] this is \\nalso called a record) \\n\u2022 Population: the universe of all possible values for a variable \\n\u2022 Sample: a subset of the population \\n\u2022 n: the number of observations for a variable \\n\u2022 Array: a sequence of observed measures (in a GIS this is also called a field and is represented in \\nan attribute table as a column) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  138 \\n\u2022 Sorted Array: an ordered, quantitative array \\nMeasures of Distribution \\nThe measure of distribution of a variable is merely a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset (hence, this is often called a frequency distribution). Typically, the values for the given variable \\nwill be grouped into a predetermined series of classes (also called intervals, bins, or categories), and the \\nnumber of data values that fall into each class will be summarized. A graph showing the number of data \\nvalues within each class range is called a histogram. For example, the percentage grades received by a \\nclass on an exam may result in the following array (n = 30): \\nArray of Exam Scores: {87, 76, 89, 90, 64, 67, 59, 79, 88, 74, 72, 99, 81, 77, 75, 86, 94, 66, 75, 74, 83, \\n100, 92, 75, 73, 70, 60, 80, 85, 57} \\nWhen placing this array into a frequency distribution, the following general guidelines should be \\nobserved. First, between five and fifteen different classes should be employed, although the exact number \\nof classes depends on the number of observations. Second, each observation goes into one and only one \\nclass. Third, when possible, use classes that cover an equal range of values (Freund and Perles \\n2006). [1] With these guidelines in mind, the exam score array shown earlier can be visualized  with the \\nfollowing histogram (Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ). \\nFigure 6.1 Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  139 \\nAs you can see from the histogram, certain descriptive observations can be readily made. Most students \\nreceived a C on the exam (70\u201379). Two students failed the exam (50\u201359). Five students received an A \\n(90\u201399). Note that this histogram does violate the third basic rule that each class cover an equal range \\nbecause an F grade ranges from 0\u201359, whereas the other grades have ranges of equal size. Regardless, in \\nthis case we are most concerned with describing the distribution of grades received during the exam. \\nTherefore, it makes perfect sense to create class ranges that best suit ou r individual needs. \\nMeasures of Central Tendency \\nWe can further explore the exam score array by applying measures of central tendency. There are three \\nprimary measures of central tendency: the mean, mode, and median. The mean, more commonly referred \\nto as the average, is the most often used measure of central tendency. To calculate the mean, simply add \\nall the values in the array and divide that sum by the number of observations. To return to the exam score \\nexample from earlier, the sum of that array is 2,340, and there are 30 observations (n = 30). So, the mean \\nis 2,340 / 30 = 78. \\nThe mode is the measure of central tendency that represents the most frequently occurring value in the \\narray. In the case of the exam scores, the mode of the array is 75 as this w as received by the most number \\nof students (three, in total). Finally, the median is the observation that, when the array is ordered from \\nlowest to highest, falls exactly in the center of the sorted array. More specifically, the median is the value \\nin the middle of the sorted array when there are an odd number of observations. Alternatively, when there \\nis an even number of observations, the median is calculated by finding the mean of the two central values. \\nIf the array of exam scores were reordered into a sorted array, the scores would be listed thusly:  \\nSorted Array of Exam Scores: {57, 59, 60, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72, 73, 74, 74, 75, 75, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, \\n83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 99} \\nSince n = 30 in this example, there are an even number of observations. Therefore, the mean of the two \\ncentral values (15th = 76 and 16th = 77) is used to calculate the median as described earlier, resulting in (76 \\n+ 77) / 2 = 76.5. Taken together, the mean, mode, and median represent the most basic ways to exam ine \\ntrends in a dataset. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  140 \\nMeasures of Dispersion \\nThe third type of descriptive statistics is measures of dispersion (also referred to as measures of \\nvariability). These measures describe the spread of data around the mean. The simplest measure of \\ndispersion is the range. The range equals the largest value minus in the dataset the smallest. In our case, \\nthe range is 99 \u2212 57 = 42. \\nThe interquartile range represents a slightly more sophisticated measure of dispersion. This method \\ndivides the data into quartiles. To accomplish this, the median is used to divide the sorted array into two \\nhalves. These halves are again divided into halves by their own median. The first quartile (Q1) is the \\nmedian of the lower half of the sorted array and is also referred to as the lower quartile. Q2 represents the \\nmedian. Q3 is the median of the upper half of the sorted array and is referred to as the upper quartile. The \\ndifference between the upper and lower quartile is the interquartile range. In the exam score example, Q1 \\n= 72.25 and Q3 = 86.75. Therefore, the interquartile range for this dataset is 86.75 \u2212 72.25 = 14.50.  \\nA third measure of dispersion is the variance (s2). To calculate the variance, subtract the raw value of each \\nexam score from the mean of the exam scores. As you may guess, some of the differences will be positive, \\nand some will be negative, resulting in the sum of differences equaling zero. As we are more interested in \\nthe magnitude of differences (or deviations) from the mean, one method to overcome this \u201czeroing\u201d \\nproperty is to square each deviation, thus removing the negative values from the output ( Figure 6.2). This \\nresults in the following: \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  141 \\nFigure 6.2 \\n \\nWe then divide the sum of squares by either n \u2212 1 (in the case of working with a sample) or n (in the case \\nof working with a population). As the exam scores given here represent the entire population of the class, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  142 \\nwe will employ Figure 6.3 \"Variance\", which results in a variance of s2 = 116.4. If we wanted to use these \\nexam scores to extrapolate information about the larger student body, we would be working with a sample \\nof the population. In that case, we would divide the sum of squares by  n \u2212 1. \\nFigure 6.3 Variance \\n \\nStandard deviation, the final measure of dispersion discussed here, is the most commonly used measure \\nof dispersion. To compensate for the squaring of each difference from the mean performed during the \\nvariance calculation, standard deviation takes the square root of the variance. As determined from Figure \\n6.4 \"Standard Deviation\", our exam score example results in a standard deviation of s = SQRT(116.4) = \\n10.8. \\nFigure 6.4 Standard Deviation \\n \\nCalculating the standard deviation allows us to make some notable inferences about the dispersion of our \\ndataset. A small standard deviation suggests the values in the dataset are clustered around the mean, \\nwhile a large standard deviation suggests the values are scattered widely around the mean. Additional \\ninferences may be made about the standard deviation if the dataset conforms to a normal distribution. A \\nnormal distribution implies that the data, when placed into a frequency distribution (histogram), looks \\nsymmetrical or \u201cbell-shaped.\u201d When not \u201cnormal,\u201d the frequency distribution of dataset is said to be \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  143 \\npositively or negatively \u201cskewed\u201d (Figure 6.5 \"Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and \\nNegatively Skewed Datasets\").

Regardless, normally distributed data maintains the property of having approxim ately \\n68 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 95 percent of the data \\nvalue fall within \u00b1 2 standard deviations of the mean. In our example, the mean is 78, and the standard \\ndeviation is 10.8. It can therefore be stated that 68 percent of the scores fall between 67.2 and 88.8 (i.e., \\n78 \u00b1 10.8), while 95 percent of the scores fall between 56.4 and 99.6 (i.e., 78 \u00b1 [10.8 * 2]). For datasets \\nthat do not conform to the normal curve, it can be assumed that 75 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 \\n2 standard deviations of the mean. \\nFigure 6.5 Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and Negatively Skewed Datasets \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The measure of distribution for a given variable is a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset and is commonly shown using a histogram. \\n\u2022 Measures of central tendency attempt to provide insights into \u201ctypical\u201d value for a dataset.  \\n\u2022 Measures of dispersion (or variability) describe the spread of data around the mean o r median. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to outline the basics of the SQL language and to understand the various \\nquery techniques available in a GIS. \\nAccess to robust search and query tools is essential to examine the general trends of a dataset.  Queries are \\nessentially questions posed to a database. The selective display and retrieval of information based on \\nthese queries are essential components of any geographic information system (GIS). There are three basic \\nmethods for searching and querying attribute data: (1) selection, (2) query by attribute, and (3) query by \\ngeography. \\nSelection \\nSelection represents the easiest way to search and query spatial data in a GIS. Sele cting features highlight \\nthose attributes of interest, both on-screen and in the attribute table, for subsequent display or analysis. \\nTo accomplish this, one selects points, lines, and polygons simply by using the cursor to \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d \\nthe feature of interest or by using the cursor to drag a box around those features. Alternatively, one can \\nselect features by using a graphic object, such as a circle, line, or polygon, to highlight all of those features \\nthat fall within the object. Advanced options for selecting subsets of data from the larger dataset include \\ncreating a new selection, selecting from the currently selected features, adding to the current selection, \\nand removing from the current selection. \\nQuery by Attribute \\nMap features and their associated data can be retrieved via the query of attribute information within the \\ndata tables. For example, search and query tools allow a user to show all the census tracts that have a \\npopulation density of 500 or greater, to show all counties that are less than or equal to 100 square \\nkilometers, or to show all convenience stores within 1 mile of an interstate highway.  \\nSpecifically, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a commonly used computer language developed to \\nquery attribute data within a relational database management system. Created by IBM in the 1970s, SQL Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  145 \\nallows for the retrieval of a subset of attribute information based on specific, user -defined criteria via the \\nimplementation of particular language elements. More recently, the use of SQL has been extended for use \\nin a GIS (Shekhar and Chawla 2003).[1] One important note related to the use of SQL is that the exact \\nexpression used to query a dataset depends on the GIS file format being examined. For example, ANSI \\nSQL is a particular version used to query ArcSDE geodatabases, while Jet SQL is used to access personal \\ngeodatabases. Similarly, shapefiles, coverages, and dBASE tables use a restricted version of SQL that \\ndoesn\u2019t support all the features of ANSI SQL or Jet SQL. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.2 \"Geospatial Database \\nManagement\", all attribute tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for an SQL \\nquery must contain primary and/or foreign keys for proper use. In addition to these keys, SQL \\nimplements clauses to structure database queries. A clause is a language element that includes the \\nSELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING query statements.  \\n\u2022 SELECT denotes what attribute table fields you wish to view. \\n\u2022 FROM denotes the attribute table in which the information resides.  \\n\u2022 WHERE denotes the user-defined criteria for the attribute information that must be met in order \\nfor it to be included in the output set. \\n\u2022 ORDER BY denotes the sequence in which the output set will be displayed.  \\n\u2022 HAVING denotes the predicate used to filter output from the ORDER BY clause.  \\nWhile the SELECT and FROM clauses are both mandatory statements in an SQL query, the WHERE is an \\noptional clause used to limit the output set. The ORDER BY and HAVING are optional clauses used to \\npresent the information in an interpretable manner. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  146 \\nFigure 6.6 Personal Addresses in \u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table \\n \\nThe following is a series of SQL expressions and results when applied to Figure 6.6 \"Personal Addresses in \\n\u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table\". The title of the attribute table is \u201cExampleTable.\u201d Note that the asterisk \\n(*) denotes a special case of SELECT whereby all columns for a given record are selected:  \\nSELECT * FROM ExampleTable WHERE City = \u201cUpland\u201d \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  147 \\nThis statement returns the following: \\n \\nConsider the following statement: \\nSELECT LastName FROM ExampleTable WHERE State = \u201cCA\u201d ORDER BY FirstName \\nThis statement results in the following table sorted in ascending order by the FirstName column (not \\nincluded in the output table as directed by the SELECT clause): \\n \\nIn addition to clauses, SQL allows for the inclusion of specific operators to further delimit the result of \\nquery. These operators can be relational, arithmetic, or Boolean and will typically appear inside of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  148 \\nconditional statements in the WHERE clause. A relational operator employs the statements equal to (=), \\nless than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), or greater than or equal to \\n(>=). Arithmetic operators are those mathematical functions that include addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), \\nmultiplication (*), and division (/). Boolean operators (also called Boolean connectors) include the \\nstatements AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. The AND connector is used to select records from the attribute \\ntable that satisfies both expressions. The OR connector selects records that satisfy either one or both \\nexpressions. The XOR connector selects records that satisfy one and only one of the expressions (the \\nfunctional opposite of the AND connector). Lastly, the NOT connector is used to negate (or unsele ct) an \\nexpression that would otherwise be true. Put into the language of probability, the AND connector is used \\nto represent an intersection, OR represents a union, and NOT represents a complement.  Figure 6.7 \"Venn \\nDiagram of SQL Operators\" illustrates the logic of these connectors, where circles A and B represent two \\nsets of intersecting data. Keep in mind that SQL is a very exacting language and minor inconsistencies in \\nthe statement, such as additional spaces, can result in a failed query.  \\nFigure 6.7 Venn Diagram of SQL Operators \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  149 \\nUsed together, these operators combine to provide the GIS user with powerful and flexible search and \\nquery options. With this in mind, can you determine the output set of the following SQL query as it is \\napplied to Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ? \\nSELECT LastName, FirstName, StreetNumber FROM ExampleTable WHERE StreetNumber >= 10000 \\nAND StreetNumber < 100 ORDER BY LastName \\nThe following are the results: \\n \\nQuery by Geography \\nQuery by geography, also known as a \u201cspatial query,\u201d allows one to highlight particular features by \\nexamining their position relative to other features. For example, a GIS provides robust tools that allow for \\nthe determination of the number of schools within 10 miles of a home. Several spatial query options are \\navailable, as outlined here. Throughout this discussion, the \u201ctarget layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset \\nwhose attributes are selected, while the \u201csource layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset on which the spatial \\nquery is applied. For example, if we were to use a state boundary polygon feature dataset to select \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  150 \\nhighways from a line feature dataset (e.g., select all the highways that run through the state of Arkansas), \\nthe state layer is the source, while the highway layer is the target.  \\n\u2022 INTERSECT. This oft-used spatial query technique selects all features in the target layer that \\nshare a common locale with the source layer. The \u201cintersect\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used as both the source and target layers (Figure 6.8). \\nFigure 6.8 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  151 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they intersect the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE WITHIN A DISTANCE OF. This technique requires the user to specify some distance \\nvalue, which is then used to buffer (Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", Section \\n7.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") the source layer. All features that intersect this buffer are \\nhighlighted in the target layer. The \u201care within a distance of\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used for both the source and target layers (Figure 6.9). \\nFigure 6.9 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  152 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are within the selected distance \\nof the red features; tan areas represent buffers around the various features. \\n\u2022 COMPLETELY CONTAIN. This spatial query technique returns those features that are entirely \\nwithin the source layer. Features with coincident boundaries are not selected by this query type. \\nThe \u201ccompletely contain\u201d query allows for points, lines, or polygons as the source layer, but only \\npolygons can be used as a target layer (Figure 6.10). \\nFigure 6.10 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they completely contain the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 ARE COMPLETELY WITHIN. This query selects those features in the target layer whose entire \\nspatial extent occurs within the geometry of the source layer.

This technique selects target features whose center, or centroid, is \\nlocated within the boundary of the source feature dataset. The \u201chave their center in\u201d query allows \\npoints, lines, or polygon layers to be used as both the source and target layers ( Figure 6.12). \\nFigure 6.12 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  154 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they have their centers in the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 SHARE A LINE SEGMENT. This spatial query selects target features whose boundary \\ngeometries share a minimum of two adjacent vertices with the source layer. The \u201cshare a line \\nsegment\u201d query allows for line or polygon layers to be used for either of the source and target \\nlayers (Figure 6.13). \\nFigure 6.13 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  155 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they share a line segment with the \\nred features. \\n\u2022 TOUCH THE BOUNDARY OF. This methodology is similar to the INTERSECT spatial query; \\nhowever, it selects line and polygon features that share a common boundary with target layer. The \\n\u201ctouch the boundary of\u201d query allows for line or polygon layers to be used as both the source and \\ntarget layers (Figure 6.14). \\nFigure 6.14 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  156 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they touch the boundary of the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 ARE IDENTICAL TO. This spatial query returns features that have the exact same geographic \\nlocation. The \u201care identical to\u201d query can be used on points, lines, or polygons, but the target layer \\ntype must be the same as the source layer type (Figure 6.15). \\nFigure 6.15 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are identical to the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE CROSSED BY THE OUTLINE OF. This selection criteria returns features that share a \\nsingle vertex but not an entire line segment. The \u201care crossed by the outline of\u201d query allows for \\nline or polygon layers to be used as both source and target layers (Figure 6.16). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  157 \\nFigure 6.16 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are crossed by the outline of the \\nred features. \\n\u2022 CONTAIN.

The objective of this section is to describe the methodologies available to parse data into various classes \\nfor visual representation in a map. \\nThe process of data classification combines raw data into predefined classes, or bins. These classes \\nmay be represented in a map by some unique symbols or, in the case of choropleth maps, by a unique \\ncolor or hue (for more on color and hue, see Chapter 8 \"Geospatial Analysis II: Raster Data\", Section \\n8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"). Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated \\ncolors to represent some statistical variable of interest. Although seemingly straightforward, there \\nare several different classification methodologies available to a cartographer. These methodologies \\nbreak the attribute values down along various interval patterns. Monmonier (1991) [1]noted that \\ndifferent classification methodologies can have a major impact on the interpretability of a given map \\nas the visual pattern presented is easily distorted by manipulating the specific interval breaks of the \\nclassification. In addition to the methodology employed, the number of classes chosen to represent \\nthe feature of interest will also significantly affect the ability of the viewer to interpret the mapped \\ninformation. Including too many classes can make a map look overly complex and confusing. Too \\nfew classes can oversimplify the map and hide important data trends. Most effective classification \\nattempts utilize approximately four to six distinct classes. \\nWhile problems potentially exist with any classification technique, a well-constructed choropleth \\nincreases the interpretability of any given map. The following discussion outlines the classification \\nmethods commonly available in geographic information system (GIS) software packages. In these \\nexamples, we will use the US Census Bureau\u2019s population statistic for US counties in 1997. These \\ndata are freely available at the US Census website (http://www.census.gov). \\nThe equal interval (or equal step) classification method divides the range of attribute values into \\nequally sized classes. The number of classes is determined by the user. The equal interval \\nclassification method is best used for continuous datasets such as precipitation or temperature. In \\nthe case of the 1997 Census Bureau data, county population values across the United States range Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  162 \\nfrom 40 (Yellowstone National Park County, MO) to 9,184,770 (Los Angeles County, CA) for a total \\nrange of 9,184,770 \u2212 40 = 9,184,730. If we decide to classify this data into 5 equal interval classes, \\nthe range of each class would cover a population spread of 9,184,730 / 5 = 1,836,946 (Figure 6.19 \\n\"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data\"). The advantage of the equal \\ninterval classification method is that it creates a legend that is easy to interpret and present to a \\nnontechnical audience. The primary disadvantage is that certain datasets will end up with most of \\nthe data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will occupy the other \\nclasses. As you can see in Figure 6.19 \"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population \\nData\", almost all the counties are assigned to the first (yellow) bin. \\nFigure 6.19 Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  163 \\nThe quantile classification method places equal numbers of observations into each class. This method \\nis best for data that is evenly distributed across its range. Figure 6.20 \"Quantiles\" shows the quantile \\nclassification method with five total classes. As there are 3,140 counties in the United States, each \\nclass in the quantile classification methodology will contain 3,140 / 5 = 628 different counties. The \\nadvantage to this method is that it often excels at emphasizing the relative position of the data values \\n(i.e., which counties contain the top 20 percent of the US population). The primary disadvantage of \\nthe quantile classification methodology is that features placed within the same class can have wildly \\ndiffering values, particularly if the data are not evenly distributed across its range. In addition, the \\nopposite can also happen whereby values with small range differences can be placed into different \\nclasses, suggesting a wider difference in the dataset than actually exists. \\nFigure 6.20 Quantiles \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  164 \\nThe natural breaks (or Jenks) classification method utilizes an algorithm to group values in classes \\nthat are separated by distinct break points. This method is best used with data that is unevenly \\ndistributed but not skewed toward either end of the distribution. Figure 6.21 \"Natural Breaks\" shows \\nthe natural breaks classification for the 1997 US county population density data. One potential \\ndisadvantage is that this method can create classes that contain widely varying number ranges. \\nAccordingly, class 1 is characterized by a range of just over 150,000, while class 5 is characterized by \\na range of over 6,000,000. In cases like this, it is often useful to either \u201ctweak\u201d the classes following \\nthe classification effort or to change the labels to some ordinal scale such as \u201csmall, medium, or \\nlarge.\u201d The latter example, in particular, can result in a map that is more comprehensible to the \\nviewer. A second disadvantage is the fact that it can be difficult to compare two or more maps created \\nwith the natural breaks classification method because the class ranges are so very specific to each \\ndataset. In these cases, datasets that may not be overly disparate may appear so in the output \\ngraphic. \\nFigure 6.21 Natural Breaks \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  165 \\nFinally, the standard deviation classification method forms each class by adding and subtracting the \\nstandard deviation from the mean of the dataset. The method is best suited to be used with data that \\nconforms to a normal distribution. In the county population example, the mean is 85,108, and the \\nstandard deviation is 277,080. Therefore, as can be seen in the legend of Figure 6.22 \"Standard \\nDeviation\", the central class contains values within a 0.5 standard deviation of the mean, while the \\nupper and lower classes contain values that are 0.5 or more standard deviations above or below the \\nmean, respectively. \\nFigure 6.22 Standard Deviation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  166 \\nIn conclusion, there are several viable data classification methodologies that can be applied to \\nchoropleth maps. Although other methods are available (e.g., equal area, optimal), those outlined \\nhere represent the most commonly used and widely available. Each of these methods presents the \\ndata in a different fashion and highlights different aspects of the trends in the dataset. Indeed, the \\nclassification methodology, as well as the number of classes utilized, can result in very widely varying \\ninterpretations of the dataset. It is incumbent upon you, the cartographer, to select the method that \\nbest suits the needs of the study and presents the data in as meaningful and transparent a way as \\npossible. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated colors to represent some statistical variable \\nof interest. \\n\u2022 Four methods for classifying data presented here include equal intervals, quartile, natural breaks, and \\nstandard deviation.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the variety of single \\noverlay analysis techniques available to analyze and manipulate the spatial attributes of a vector feature \\ndataset. \\nAs the name suggests, single layer analyses are those that are undertaken on an individual feature \\ndataset. Buffering is the process of creating an output polygon layer containing a zone (or zones) of a \\nspecified width around an input point, line, or polygon feature. Buffers are particularly suited for \\ndetermining the area of influence around features of interest. Geoprocessing is a suite of tools \\nprovided by many geographic information system (GIS) software packages that allow the user to \\nautomate many of the mundane tasks associated with manipulating GIS data. Geoprocessing usually \\ninvolves the input of one or more feature datasets, followed by a spatially explicit analysis, and \\nresulting in an output feature dataset. \\nBuffering \\nBuffers are common vector analysis tools used to address questions of proximity in a GIS and can be used \\non points, lines, or polygons (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features\" ). For \\ninstance, suppose that a natural resource manager wants to ensure that no areas are disturbed within \\n1,000 feet of breeding habitat for the federally endangered Delhi Sands flower- loving fly (Rhaphiomidas \\nterminatus abdominalis). This species is found only in the few remaining Delhi Sands soil formations of \\nthe western United States. To accomplish this task, a 1,000-foot protection zone (buffer) could be created \\naround all the observed point locations of the species. Alternatively, the manager may decide th at there is \\nnot enough point-specific location information related to this rare species and decide to protect all Delhi \\nSands soil formations. In this case, he or she could create a 1,000-foot buffer around all polygons labeled \\nas \u201cDelhi Sands\u201d on a soil formations dataset. In either case, the use of buffers provides a quick-and-easy \\ntool for determining which areas are to be maintained as preserved habitat for the endangered fly.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  169 \\nFigure 7.1 Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features \\n \\nSeveral buffering options are available to refine the output. For example, the buffer tool will typically \\nbuffer only selected features. If no features are selected, all features will be buffered. Two primary types of \\nbuffers are available to the GIS users: constant width and variable width. Constant width buffersrequire \\nusers to input a value by which features are buffered (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and \\nPolygon Features\"), such as is seen in the examples in the preceding paragraph. Variable width buffers, on \\nthe other hand, call on a premade buffer field within the attribute table to determine the buffer width for \\neach specific feature in the dataset (Figure 7.2 \"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) \\nVariable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple Ring Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) \\nNondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\"). \\nIn addition, users can choose to dissolve or not dissolve the boundaries between overlapping, coincident \\nbuffer areas. Multiple ring buffers can be made such that a series of concentric buffer zones (much like an \\narchery target) are created around the originating feature at user- specified distances (Figure 7.2 \\n\"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multi ple Ring Buffers, \\n(c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\" ). In the case of \\npolygon layers, buffers can be created that include the originating polygon feature as part of the buffer or \\nthey be created as a doughnut buffer that excludes the input polygon area. Setback buffers are similar to \\ndoughnut buffers; however, they only buffer the area inside of the polygon boundary. Linear features can \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  170 \\nbe buffered on both sides of the line, only on the left, or only on t he right. Linear features can also be \\nbuffered so that the end points of the line are rounded (ending in a half- circle) or flat (ending in a \\nrectangle). \\nFigure 7.2 Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple \\nRing Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer \\n \\nGeoprocessing Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  171 \\n\u201cGeoprocessing\u201d is a loaded term in the field of GIS. The term can (and should) be widely applied to any \\nattempt to manipulate GIS data. However, the term came into common usage due to its application to a \\nsomewhat arbitrary suite of single layer and multiple layer analytical techniques in the Geoprocessing \\nWizard of ESRI\u2019s ArcView software package in the mid-1990s. Regardless, the suite of geoprocessing tools \\navailable in a GIS greatly expand and simplify many of the management and manipulation processes \\nassociated with vector feature datasets. The primary use of these tools is to automate the repetitive \\npreprocessing needs of typical spatial analyses and to assemble exact graphical representations for \\nsubsequent analysis and/or inclusion in presentations and final mapping products. The union, intersect, \\nsymmetrical difference, and identity overlay methods discussed in Section 7.2.2 \"Other Multilayer \\nGeoprocessing Options\" are often used in conjunction with these geoprocessing tools. The following \\nrepresents the most common geoprocessing tools. \\nThe dissolve operation combines adjacent polygon features in a single feature dataset based o n a single \\npredetermined attribute. For example, part (a) ofFigure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing \\nFunctions\" shows the boundaries of seven different parcels of land, owned by four different families \\n(labeled 1 through 4). The dissolve tool automatically combines all adjacent features with the same \\nattribute values. The result is an output layer with the same extent as the original but without all of the \\nunnecessary, intervening line segments. The dissolved output layer is much easier to visually interpret \\nwhen the map is classified according to the dissolved field. \\nThe append operation creates an output polygon layer by combining the spatial extent of two or more \\nlayers (part (d) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). For use with point, line, and \\npolygon datasets, the output layer will be the same feature type as the input layers (which must each be \\nthe same feature type as well). Unlike the dissolve tool, append does not remove the boundary lines \\nbetween appended layers (in the case of lines and polygons). Therefore, it is often useful to perform a \\ndissolve after the use of the append tool to remove these potentially unnecessary dividing lines. Append is \\nfrequently used to mosaic data layers, such as digital US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5- minute \\ntopographic maps, to create a single map for analysis and/or display.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  172 \\nThe select operation creates an output layer based on a user-defined query that selects particular features \\nfrom the input layer (part (f) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). The output layer \\ncontains only those features that are selected during the query. For example, a city planner may choose to \\nperform a select on all areas that are zoned \u201cresidential\u201d so he or she can quickly assess which areas in \\ntown are suitable for a proposed housing development. \\nFinally, the merge operation combines features within a point, line, or polygon layer into a single feature \\nwith identical attribute information. Often, the original features will have different values for a given \\nattribute. In this case, the first attribute encountered is carried over into the attribute table, and the \\nremaining attributes are lost. This operation is particularly useful when polygons are found to be \\nunintentionally overlapping. Merge will conveniently combine these features into a single entity. \\nFigure 7.3 Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Buffers are frequently used to create zones of a specified width around points, lines, and polygons.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  173 \\n\u2022 Vector buffering options include constant or variable widths, multiple rings, doughnuts, setbacks, and \\ndissolve. \\n\u2022 Common single layer geoprocessing operations on vector layers include dissolve, merge, append, and \\nselect. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the implementation \\nof basic multiple layer operations and methodologies used on vector feature datasets.  \\nAmong the most powerful and commonly used tools in a geographic information system (GIS) is the \\noverlay of cartographic information. In a GIS, an overlay is the process of taking two or more \\ndifferent thematic maps of the same area and placing them on top of one another to form a new map \\n(Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector Layers, as \\nWell as Raster Layers\"). Inherent in this process, the overlay function combines not only the spatial \\nfeatures of the dataset but also the attribute information as well. \\nFigure 7.4 A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector \\nLayers, as Well as Raster Layers \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  175 \\nA common example used to illustrate the overlay process is, \u201cWhere is the best place to put a mall?\u201d \\nImagine you are a corporate bigwig and are tasked with determining where your company\u2019s next \\nshopping mall will be placed. How would you attack this problem? With a GIS at your command, \\nanswering such spatial questions begins with amassing and overlaying pertinent spatial data layers. \\nFor example, you may first want to determine what areas can support the mall by accumulating \\ninformation on which land parcels are for sale and which are zoned for commercial development. \\nAfter collecting and overlaying the baseline information on available development zones, you can \\nbegin to determine which areas offer the most economic opportunity by collecting regional \\ninformation on average household income, population density, location of proximal shopping \\ncenters, local buying habits, and more. Next, you may want to collect information on restrictions or \\nroadblocks to development such as the cost of land, cost to develop the land, community response to \\ndevelopment, adequacy of transportation corridors to and from the proposed mall, tax rates, and so \\nforth. Indeed, simply collecting and overlaying spatial datasets provides a valuable tool for \\nvisualizing and selecting the optimal site for such a business endeavor. \\nOverlay Operations \\nSeveral basic overlay processes are available in a GIS for vector datasets: point -in-polygon, polygon-on-\\npoint, line-on-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-on-polygon. As you may be able to \\ndivine from the names, one of the overlay dataset must always be a line or polygon layer, while the second \\nmay be point, line, or polygon. The new layer produced following the overlay operation is termed the \\n\u201coutput\u201d layer. \\nThe point-in-polygon overlay operation requires a point input layer and a polygon overlay layer. Upon \\nperforming this operation, a new output point layer is returned that includes  all the points that occur \\nwithin the spatial extent of the overlay (Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, \\nLine, and Polygon Vector Layers, as Well as Raster Layers\"). In addition, all the points in the output layer \\ncontain their original attribute information as well as the attribute information from the overlay. For \\nexample, suppose you were tasked with determining if an endangered species residing in a national park \\nwas found primarily in a particular vegetation community. The first step would be to acquire the point Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  176 \\noccurrence locales for the species in question, plus a polygon overlay layer showing the vegetation \\ncommunities within the national park boundary. Upon performing the point -in-polygon overlay \\noperation, a new point file is created that contains all the points that occur within the national park. The \\nattribute table of this output point file would also contain information about the vegetation communities \\nbeing utilized by the species at the time of observation. A quick sca n of this output layer and its attribute \\ntable would allow you to determine where the species was found in the park and to review the vegetation \\ncommunities in which it occurred. This process would enable park employees to make informed \\nmanagement decisions regarding which onsite habitats to protect to ensure continued site utilization by \\nthe species. \\nFigure 7.5 Point-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nAs its name suggests, the polygon-on-point overlay operation is the opposite of the point-in-polygon \\noperation. In this case, the polygon layer is the input, while the point layer is the overlay. The polygon \\nfeatures that overlay these points are selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For  \\nexample, given a point dataset containing the locales of some type of crime and a polygon dataset \\nrepresenting city blocks, a polygon-on-point overlay operation would allow police to select the city blocks \\nin which crimes have been known to occur and hence determine those locations where an increased police \\npresence may be warranted. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  177 \\nFigure 7.6 Polygon-on-Point Overlay \\n \\nA line-on-line overlay operation requires line features for both the input and overlay layer. The output \\nfrom this operation is a point or points located precisely at the intersection(s) of the two linear datasets \\n(Figure 7.7 \"Line-on-Line Overlay\"). For example, a linear feature dataset containing railroad tracks may \\nbe overlain on linear road network. The resulting point dataset contain s all the locales of the railroad \\ncrossings over a town\u2019s road network. The attribute table for this railroad crossing point dataset would \\ncontain information on both the railroad and the road over which it passed.  \\nFigure 7.7 Line-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nThe line-in-polygon overlay operation is similar to the point-in-polygon overlay, with that obvious \\nexception that a line input layer is used instead of a point input layer. In this case, each line that has any \\npart of its extent within the overlay polygon layer will be included in the output line layer, although these \\nlines will be truncated at the boundary of the overlay (Figure 7.9 \"Polygon-on-Line Overlay\"). For \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  178 \\nexample, a line-in-polygon overlay can take an input layer of interstate line segments and a polygon \\noverlay representing city boundaries and produce a linear output layer of highway segments that fall \\nwithin the city boundary. The attribute table for the output interstate line segment will contain \\ninformation on the interstate name as well as the city through which they pass. \\nFigure 7.8 Line-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe polygon-on-line overlay operation is the opposite of the line-in-polygon operation. In this case, the \\npolygon layer is the input, while the line layer is the overlay. The polygon featu res that overlay these lines \\nare selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For example, given a layer containing the \\npath of a series of telephone poles/wires and a polygon map contain city parcels, a polygon -on-line \\noverlay operation would allow a land assessor to select those parcels containing overhead telephone wires.  \\nFigure 7.9 Polygon-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  179 \\nFinally, the polygon-in-polygon overlay operation employs a polygon input and a polygon overlay. This is \\nthe most commonly used overlay operation. Using this method, the polygon input and overlay layers are \\ncombined to create an output polygon layer with the extent of the overlay. The attribute table will contain \\nspatial data and attribute information from both the input and overlay layers ( Figure 7.10 \"Polygon-in-\\nPolygon Overlay\"). For example, you may choose an input polygon layer of soil types with an overlay of \\nagricultural fields within a given county. The output polygon layer would contain information on both the \\nlocation of agricultural fields and soil types throughout the county.  \\nFigure 7.10 Polygon-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe overlay operations discussed previously assume that the user desires the overlain layers to be \\ncombined. This is not always the case. Overlay methods can be more complex than that and therefore \\nemploy the basic Boolean operators: AND, OR, and XOR (see Section 6.1.2 \"Measures of Central \\nTendency\"). Depending on which operator(s) are utilized, the overlay method employed will result in an \\nintersection, union, symmetrical difference, or identity. \\nSpecifically, the union overlay method employs the OR operator. A union can be used only in the case of \\ntwo polygon input layers. It preserves all features, attribute information, and spatial extents from both \\ninput layers (part (a) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). This overlay method is based on the \\npolygon-in-polygon operation described in Section 7.1.1 \"Buffering\". \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  180 \\nAlternatively, the intersection overlay method employs the AND operator. An intersection requires a \\npolygon overlay, but can accept a point, line, or polygon input. The output layer covers the spatial extent \\nof the overlay and contains features and attributes from both the input and overlay (part (b) of Figure 7.11 \\n\"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nThe symmetrical difference overlay method employs the XOR operator, which results in the opposite \\noutput as an intersection. This method requires both input layers to be polygons. The output polygon \\nlayer produced by the symmetrical difference method represents those areas common to only one of the \\nfeature datasets (part (c) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nIn addition to these simple operations, the identity (also referred to as \u201cminus\u201d) overlay method creates \\nan output layer with the spatial extent of the input layer (part (d) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \\n\") but includes attribute information from the overlay (referred to as the \u201cidentity\u201d layer, in this case). The \\ninput layer can be points, lines, or polygons. The identity layer must be a p olygon dataset. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  181 \\nFigure 7.11 Vector Overlay Methods \\n \\nOther Multilayer Geoprocessing Options \\nIn addition to the aforementioned vector overlay methods, other common multiple layer geoprocessing \\noptions are available to the user. These included the clip, erase, and split tools. The  clip geoprocessing \\noperation is used to extract those features from an input point, line, or polygon layer that falls within the \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  182 \\nspatial extent of the clip layer (part (e) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). Following the clip, all \\nattributes from the preserved portion of the input layer are included in the output. If any features are \\nselected during this process, only those selected features within the clip boundary will be included in the \\noutput. For example, the clip tool could be used to clip the extent of a river floodplain by the extent of a \\ncounty boundary. This would provide county managers with insight into which portions of the floodplain \\nthey are responsible to maintain. This is similar to the intersect overlay method; however, the attribute \\ninformation associated with the clip layer is not carried into the output layer following the overlay.  \\nThe erase geoprocessing operation is essentially the opposite of a clip. Whereas the clip tool preserves \\nareas within an input layer, the erase tool preserves only those areas outside the extent of the analogous \\nerase layer (part (f) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). While the input layer can be a point, line, or \\npolygon dataset, the erase layer must be a polygon dataset. Continuing with our clip example, county \\nmanagers could then use the erase tool to erase the areas of private ownership within the county \\nfloodplain area. Officials could then focus specifically on public reaches of the countywide floodplain for \\ntheir upkeep and maintenance responsibilities. \\nThe split geoprocessing operation is used to divide an input layer into two or more layers based on a split \\nlayer (part (g) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). The split layer must be a polygon, while the input \\nlayers can be point, line, or polygon. For example, a homeowner\u2019s association may choose to split up a \\ncountywide soil series map by parcel boundaries so each homeowner has a specific soil map for their own \\nparcel. \\nSpatial Join \\nA spatial join is a hybrid between an attribute operation and a vector overlay operation. Like the \u201cjoin\u201d \\nattribute operation described in Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\", a spatial join results in the combination \\nof two feature dataset tables by a common attribute field. Unlike the attribute operation, a spatial join \\ndetermines which fields from a source layer\u2019s attribute table are appended to the destination layer\u2019s \\nattribute table based on the relative locations of selected features. This relationship is explicitly based on \\nthe property of proximity or containment between the source and destination layers, rather than the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  183 \\nprimary or secondary keys. The proximity option is used when the source layer is a point or line feature \\ndataset, while the containment option is used when the source layer is a polygon feature dataset. \\nWhen employing the proximity (or \u201cnearest\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the closest given feature in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table. The \\nproximity option will typically add a numerical field to the destination layer attribute table, called \\n\u201cDistance,\u201d within which the measured distance between the source and destination feature is placed. For \\nexample, suppose a city agency had a point dataset showing all known polluters in town and a line dataset \\nof all the river segments within the municipal boundary. This agency could then perform a proximity -\\nbased spatial join to determine the nearest river segment that would most likely be affected by each \\npolluter. \\nWhen using the containment (or \u201cinside\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the polygon source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the record in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table that it contains. If a \\ndestination layer feature (point, line, or polygon) is not completely contained within a source polygon, no \\nvalue will be appended. For example, suppose a pool cleaning business wanted to hone its marketing \\nservices by providing flyers only to homes that owned a pool. They could obtain a point dataset containing \\nthe location of every pool in the county and a polygon parcel map for that same area. That business could \\nthen conduct a spatial join to append the parcel information to the pool locales. This would provide them \\nwith information on the each land parcel that contained a pool and they could subsequently send their \\nmailers only to those homes. \\nOverlay Errors \\nAlthough overlays are one of the most important tools in a GIS analyst\u2019s toolbox, there are some problems \\nthat can arise when using this methodology. In particular, slivers are a common error produced when two \\nslightly misaligned vector layers are overlain (Figure 7.12 \"Slivers\"). This misalignment can come from \\nseveral sources including digitization errors, interpretation errors, or source map errors (Chang \\n2008). [1] For example, most vegetation and soil maps are created from field survey data, satellite images, \\nand aerial photography. While you can imagine that the boundaries of soils and vegetation frequently \\ncoincide, the fact that they were most likely created by different researchers at different times suggests Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  184 \\nthat their boundaries will not perfectly overlap. To ameliorate this problem, GIS software incorporates \\nacluster tolerance option that forces nearby lines to be snapped together if they fall within a user-specified \\ndistance. Care must be taken when assigning cluster tolerance. Too strict a setting will not snap shared \\nboundaries, while too lenient a setting will snap unintended, neighboring boundaries together (Wang and  \\nDonaghy 1995). [2] \\nFigure 7.12 Slivers \\n \\nA second potential source of error associated with the overlay process is error \\npropagation. Error propagation arises when inaccuracies are present in the original input and overlay \\nlayers and are propagated through to the output layer (MacDougall 1975).  [3] These errors can be related to \\npositional inaccuracies of the points, lines, or polygons. Alternatively, they can arise from attribute errors \\nin the original data table(s). Regardless of the source, error propagation represents a common problem in \\noverlay analysis, the impact of which depends largely on the accuracy and precision requirements of the \\nproject at hand. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, polygon-on-point, line-\\non-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-in-polygon models. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  185 \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Raster data are particularly suited to certain \\ntypes of analyses, such as basic geoprocessing (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"), \\nsurface analysis (Section 8.2 \"Scale of Analysis\"), and terrain mapping (Section 8.3 \"Surface \\nAnalysis: Spatial Interpolation\"). While not always true, raster data can simplify many types of \\nspatial analyses that would otherwise be overly cumbersome to perform on vector datasets. Some of \\nthe most common of these techniques are presented in this chapter. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  187 \\n8.1 Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to become familiar with basic single and multiple raster geoprocessing \\ntechniques. \\nLike the geoprocessing tools available for use on vector datasets (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing \\nwith Rasters\"), raster data can undergo similar spatial operations. Although the actual computation \\nof these operations is significantly different from their vector counterparts, their conceptual \\nunderpinning is similar. The geoprocessing techniques covered here include both single layer \\n(Section 8.1.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\") and multiple layer (Section 8.1.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") \\noperations. \\nSingle Layer Analysis \\nReclassifying, or recoding, a dataset is commonly one of the first steps undertaken during raster analysis. \\nReclassification is basically the single layer process of assigning a new class or range value to all pixels in \\nthe dataset based on their original values (Figure 8.1 \"Raster Reclassification\". For example, an elevation \\ngrid commonly contains a different value for nearly every cell within its extent. These values could be \\nsimplified by aggregating each pixel value in a few discrete classes (i.e., 0 \u2013100 = \u201c1,\u201d 101\u2013200 = \u201c2,\u201d 201\u2013\\n300 = \u201c3,\u201d etc.). This simplification allows for fewer unique values and cheaper storage requirements. In \\naddition, these reclassified layers are often used as inputs in secondary analyses, such as those discussed \\nlater in this section. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  188 \\nFigure 8.1 Raster Reclassification \\n \\nAs described in Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", buffering is the process of creating \\nan output dataset that contains a zone (or zones) of a specified width around an input feature. In the case \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  189 \\nof raster datasets, these input features are given as a grid cell or a group of grid cells containing a uniform  \\nvalue (e.g., buffer all cells whose value = 1). Buffers are particularly suited for determining the area of \\ninfluence around features of interest. Whereas buffering vector data results in a precise area of influence \\nat a specified distance from the target feature, raster buffers tend to be approximations representing those \\ncells that are within the specified distance range of the target (Figure 8.2 \"Raster Buffer around a Target \\nCell(s)\"). Most geographic information system (GIS) programs calculate raster buffers by creating a grid \\nof distance values from the center of the target cell(s) to the center of the neighboring cells and then \\nreclassifying those distances such that a \u201c1\u201d represents those cells composing the original target, a \u201c2\u201d \\nrepresents those cells within the user-defined buffer area, and a \u201c0\u201d represents those cells outside of the \\ntarget and buffer areas. These cells could also be further classified to represent multiple ring buffers by \\nincluding values of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d \u201c5,\u201d and so forth, to represent concentric distances around the target cell(s). \\nFigure 8.2 Raster Buffer around a Target Cell(s) \\n \\nMultiple Layer Analysis \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  190 \\nA raster dataset can also be clipped similar to a vector dataset (Figure 8.3 \"Clipping a Raster to a Vector \\nPolygon Layer\"). Here, the input raster is overlain by a vector polygon clip layer. The raster clip process \\nresults in a single raster that is identical to the input raster but shares the extent of the polygon clip layer.  \\nFigure 8.3 Clipping a Raster to a Vector Polygon Layer \\n \\nRaster overlays are relatively simple compared to their vector counterparts and require much less \\ncomputational power (Burroughs 1983). [1] Despite their simplicity, it is important to ensure that all \\noverlain rasters are coregistered (i.e., spatially aligned), cover identical areas, and maintain equal \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  191 \\nresolution (i.e., cell size). If these assumptions are violated, the analysis will either fail or the resulting \\noutput layer will be flawed. With this in mind, there are several different methodologies for performing a \\nraster overlay (Chrisman 2002). [2] \\nThe mathematical raster overlay is the most common overlay method. The numbers within the aligned \\ncells of the input grids can undergo any user-specified mathematical transformation. Following the \\ncalculation, an output raster is produced that contains a new value for each cell ( Figure 8.4 \"Mathematical \\nRaster Overlay\"). As you can imagine, there are many uses for such functionality. In particular, raster \\noverlay is often used in risk assessment studies where various layers are combined to produce an outcome \\nmap showing areas of high risk/reward. \\nFigure 8.4 Mathematical Raster Overlay \\n \\nTwo input raster layers are overlain to produce an output raster with summed cell values. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  192 \\nThe Boolean raster overlay method represents a second powerful technique. As discussed in Chapter 6 \\n\"Data Characteristics and Visualization\", the Boolean connectors AND, OR, and XOR can be employed to \\ncombine the information of two overlying input raster datasets into a single output raste r. Similarly, the \\nrelational raster overlay method utilizes relational operators (<, <=, =, <>, >, and =>) to evaluate \\nconditions of the input raster datasets. In both the Boolean and relational overlay methods, cells that meet \\nthe evaluation criteria are typically coded in the output raster layer with a 1, while those evaluated as false \\nreceive a value of 0. \\nThe simplicity of this methodology, however, can also lead to easily overlooked errors in interpretation if \\nthe overlay is not designed properly. Assume that a natural resource manager has two input raster \\ndatasets she plans to overlay; one showing the location of trees (\u201c0\u201d = no tree; \u201c1\u201d = tree) and one showing \\nthe location of urban areas (\u201c0\u201d = not urban; \u201c1\u201d = urban).

The objective of this section is to understand how local, neighborhood, zonal, and global analyses can be \\napplied to raster datasets. \\nRaster analyses can be undertaken on four different scales of operation: local, neighborhood, zonal, \\nand global. Each of these presents unique options to the GIS analyst and are presented here in this \\nsection. \\nLocal Operations \\nLocal operations can be performed on single or multiple rasters. When used on a single raster, a local \\noperation usually takes the form of applying some mathematical transformation to each individual cell in \\nthe grid. For example, a researcher may obtain a digital elevation model (DEM) with each cell value \\nrepresenting elevation in feet. If it is preferred to represent those elevations in meters, a simple, \\narithmetic transformation (original elevation in feet * 0.3048 = new elevation in meters) of each cell value \\ncan be performed locally to accomplish this task. \\nWhen applied to multiple rasters, it becomes possible to perform such analyses as changes over time. \\nGiven two rasters containing information on groundwater depth on a parcel of land at Year 2000 and \\nYear 2010, it is simple to subtract these values and place the difference in an output raster that will note \\nthe change in groundwater between those two times (Figure 8.5 \"Local Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nThese local analyses can become somewhat more complicated however, as the number  of input rasters \\nincrease. For example, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) applies a local mathematical formula to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  194 \\nseveral overlying rasters including rainfall intensity, erodibility of the soil, slope, cultivation type, and \\nvegetation type to determine the average soil loss (in tons) in a grid cell. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  195 \\nFigure 8.5 Local Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nNeighborhood Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  196 \\nTobler\u2019s first law of geography states that \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are \\nmore related than distant things.\u201d Neighborhood operations represent a group of frequently used spatial \\nanalysis techniques that rely heavily on this concept. Neighborhood functions examine the relationship of \\nan object with similar surrounding objects. They can be performed on point, line, or polygon vector \\ndatasets as well as on raster datasets. In the case of vector datasets, neighborhood analysis is most \\nfrequently used to perform basic searches. For example, given a point dataset co ntaining the location of \\nconvenience stores, a GIS could be employed to determine the number of stores within 5 miles of a linear \\nfeature (i.e., Interstate 10 in California). \\nNeighborhood analyses are often more sophisticated when used with raster datasets. Raster analyses \\nemploy moving windows, also called filters or kernels, to calculate new cell values for every location \\nthroughout the raster layer\u2019s extent. These moving windows can take many different forms depending on \\nthe type of output desired and the phenomena being examined. For example, a rectangular, 3-by-3 \\nmoving window is commonly used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum, maximum, \\nor range of values immediately surrounding a given \u201ctarget\u201d cell (Figure 8.6 \"Common Neighborhood \\nTypes around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). Thetarget cell is that cell \\nfound in the center of the 3-by-3 moving window. The moving window passes over every cell in the raster. \\nAs it passes each central target cell, the nine values in the 3-by-3 window are used to calculate a new value \\nfor that target cell. This new value is placed in the identical location in the output raster. If one wanted to \\nexamine a larger sphere of influence around the target cells, the moving wi ndow could be expanded to 5 \\nby 5, 7 by 7, and so forth. Additionally, the moving window need not be a simple rectangle. Other shapes \\nused to calculate neighborhood statistics include the annulus, wedge, and circle ( Figure 8.6 \"Common \\nNeighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  197 \\nFigure 8.6 Common Neighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, \\n(d) Wedge \\n \\nNeighborhood operations are commonly used for data simplification on rast er datasets. An analysis that \\naverages neighborhood values would result in a smoothed output raster with dampened highs and lows as \\nthe influence of the outlying data values are reduced by the averaging process. Alternatively, \\nneighborhood analyses can be used to exaggerate differences in a dataset. Edge enhancement is a type of \\nneighborhood analysis that examines the range of values in the moving window. A large range value \\nwould indicate that an edge occurs within the extent of the window, while a small r ange indicates the lack \\nof an edge. \\nZonal Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  198 \\nA zonal operation is employed on groups of cells of similar value or like features, not surprisingly called \\nzones (e.g., land parcels, political/municipal units, waterbodies, soil/vegetation types). Thes e zones could \\nbe conceptualized as raster versions of polygons. Zonal rasters are often created by reclassifying an input \\nraster into just a few categories (see Section 8.2.2 \"Neighborhood Operations\" ). Zonal operations may be \\napplied to a single raster or two overlaying rasters. Given a single input raster, zonal operations measure \\nthe geometry of each zone in the raster, such as area, perimeter, thickness, and centroid. Given two rasters \\nin a zonal operation, one input raster and one zonal raster, a zonal operation produces an output raster, \\nwhich summarizes the cell values in the input raster for each zone in the zonal raster ( Figure 8.7 \"Zonal \\nOperation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.7 Zonal Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nZonal operations and analyses are valuable in fields of study such as landscape ecology where the \\ngeometry and spatial arrangement of habitat patches can significantly affect the type and number of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  199 \\nspecies that can reside in them. Similarly, zonal analyses can effectively quantify the narrow habitat \\ncorridors that are important for regional movement of flightless, migratory animal species moving \\nthrough otherwise densely urbanized areas. \\nGlobal Operations \\nGlobal operations are similar to zonal operations whereby the entire raster dataset\u2019s extent represents a \\nsingle zone. Typical global operations include determining basic statistical values for the raster as a whole. \\nFor example, the minimum, maximum, average, range, and so forth can be quickly calculated over th e \\nentire extent of the input raster and subsequently be output to a raster in which every cell contains that \\ncalculated value (Figure 8.8 \"Global Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.8 Global Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  200 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Local raster operations examine only a single target cell during analysis.  \\n\u2022 Neighborhood raster operations examine the relationship of a target cell proximal surrounding cells.  \\n\u2022 Zonal raster operations examine groups of cells that occur within a uniform feature type.  \\n\u2022 Global raster operations examine the entire areal extent of the dataset.  \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to GIS surfaces, how to \\ncreate them, and how they are used to answer specific spatial questions.  \\nA surface is a vector or raster dataset that contains an attribute value for every locale throughout its \\nextent. In a sense, all raster datasets are surfaces, but not all vector datasets are surfaces. Surfaces \\nare commonly used in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize phenomena such as \\nelevation, temperature, slope, aspect, rainfall, and more. In a GIS, surface analyses are usually \\ncarried out on either raster datasets or TINs (Triangular Irregular Network; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial \\nData Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File Formats\"), but isolines or point arrays can also be \\nused. Interpolation is used to estimate the value of a variable at an unsampled location from \\nmeasurements made at nearby or neighboring locales. Spatial interpolation methods draw on the \\ntheoretical creed of Tobler\u2019s first law of geography, which states that \u201ceverything is related to \\neverything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d Indeed, this basic tenet \\nof positive spatial autocorrelation forms the backbone of many spatial analyses (Figure 8.9 \"Positive \\nand Negative Spatial Autocorrelation\"). \\nFigure 8.9 Positive and Negative Spatial Autocorrelation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  202 \\nCreating Surfaces \\nThe ability to create a surface is a valuable tool in a GIS. The creation of raster surfaces, however, often \\nstarts with the creation of a vector surface. One common method to create such a vector surface from \\npoint data is via the generation of Thiessen (or Voronoi) polygons. Thiessen polygons are mathematically \\ngenerated areas that define the sphere of influence around each point in the dataset relative to all other \\npoints (Figure 8.10 \"A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons\" ). Specifically, polygon \\nboundaries are calculated as the perpendicular bisectors of the lines between e ach pair of neighboring \\npoints. The derived Thiessen polygons can then be used as crude vector surfaces that provide attribute \\ninformation across the entire area of interest. A common example of Thiessen polygons is the creation of a \\nrainfall surface from an array of rain gauge point locations. Employing some basic reclassification \\ntechniques, these Thiessen polygons can be easily converted to equivalent raster representations.  \\nFigure 8.10 A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons \\n \\nWhile the creation of Thiessen polygons results in a polygon layer whereby each polygon, or raster zone, \\nmaintains a single value, interpolation is a potentially complex statistical technique that estimates the \\nvalue of all unknown points between the known points. The three basic methods used to create \\ninterpolated surfaces are spline, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and trend surface. The spline \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  203 \\ninterpolation method forces a smoothed curve through the set of known input points to estimate the \\nunknown, intervening values. IDW interpolation estimates the values of unknown locations using the \\ndistance to proximal, known values. The weight placed on the value of each proximal value is in inverse \\nproportion to its spatial distance from the target locale. Therefore, the farther the proximal point, the less \\nweight it carries in defining the target point\u2019s value. Finally, trend surface interpolation is the most \\ncomplex method as it fits a multivariate statistical regression model to the known points, assigning a value \\nto each unknown location based on that model. \\nOther highly complex interpolation methods exist such as kriging. Kriging is a complex geostatistical \\ntechnique, similar to IDW, that employs semivariograms to interpolate the values of an input point layer \\nand is more akin to a regression analysis (Krige 1951). [1] The specifics of the kriging methodology will not \\nbe covered here as this is beyond the scope of this text. For more information on kriging, consult review \\ntexts such as Stein (1999). [2] \\nInversely, raster data can also be used to create vector surfaces. For instance, isoline maps are made up of \\ncontinuous, nonoverlapping lines that connect points of equal value. Isolines have specific monikers \\ndepending on the type of information they model (e.g., elevation = contour lines, temperature = \\nisotherms, barometric pressure = isobars, wind speed = isotachs) Figure 8.11 \"Contour Lines Derived \\nfrom a DEM\" shows an isoline elevation map. As the elevation values of this digital elevation model \\n(DEM) range from 450 to 950 feet, the contour lines are placed at 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 feet \\nelevations throughout the extent of the image. In this example, the contour interval, defined as the vertical \\ndistance between each contour line, is 100 feet. The contour interval is determined by the user during the \\ncreating of the surface. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  204 \\nFigure 8.11 Contour Lines Derived from a DEM \\n \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Spatial interpolation is used to estimate those unknown values found between known data points.  \\n\u2022 Spatial autocorrelation is positive when mapped features are clustered and is negative when mapped \\nfeatures are uniformly distributed. \\n\u2022 Thiessen polygons are a valuable tool for converting point arrays into polygon surfaces.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to learn to apply basic raster surface analyses to terrain mapping \\napplications. \\nSurface analysis is often referred to as terrain (elevation) analysis when information related to slope, \\naspect, viewshed, hydrology, volume, and so forth are calculated on raster surfaces such as DEMs \\n(digital elevation models; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File \\nFormats\"). In addition, surface analysis techniques can also be applied to more esoteric mapping \\nefforts such as probability of tornados or concentration of infant mortalities in a given region. In this \\nsection we discuss a few methods for creating surfaces and common surface analysis techniques \\nrelated to terrain datasets. \\nSeveral common raster-based neighborhood analyses provide valuable insights into the surface \\nproperties of terrain. Slope maps (part (a) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") are excellent for analyzing and visualizing landform characteristics and are \\nfrequently used in conjunction with aspect maps (defined later) to assess watershed units, inventory \\nforest resources, determine habitat suitability, estimate slope erosion potential, and so forth. They \\nare typically created by fitting a planar surface to a 3-by-3 moving window around each target cell. \\nWhen dividing the horizontal distance across the moving window (which is determined via the \\nspatial resolution of the raster image) by the vertical distance within the window (measure as the \\ndifference between the largest cell value and the central cell value), the slope is relatively easily \\nobtained. The output raster of slope values can be calculated as either percent slope or degree of \\nslope. \\nAny cell that exhibits a slope must, by definition, be oriented in a known direction. This orientation \\nis referred to as aspect. Aspect maps (part (b) ofFigure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") use slope information to produce output raster images whereby the value of each \\ncell denotes the direction it faces. This is usually coded as either one of the eight ordinal directions \\n(north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) or in degrees from 1\u00b0 (nearly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  206 \\ndue north) to 360\u00b0 (back to due north). Flat surfaces have no aspect and are given a value of \u22121. To \\ncalculate aspect, a 3-by-3 moving window is used to find the highest and lowest elevations around \\nthe target cell. If the highest cell value is located at the top-left of the window (\u201ctop\u201d being due north) \\nand the lowest value is at the bottom-right, it can be assumed that the aspect is southeast. The \\ncombination of slope and aspect information is of great value to researchers such as botanists and \\nsoil scientists because sunlight availability varies widely between north-facing and south-facing \\nslopes. Indeed, the various light and moisture regimes resulting from aspect changes encourage \\nvegetative and edaphic differences. \\nA hillshade map (part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps\") \\nrepresents the illumination of a surface from some hypothetical, user-defined light source \\n(presumably, the sun). Indeed, the slope of a hill is relatively brightly lit when facing the sun and \\ndark when facing away. Using the surface slope, aspect, angle of incoming light, and solar altitude as \\ninputs, the hillshade process codes each cell in the output raster with an 8-bit value (0\u2013255) \\nincreasing from black to white. As you can see in part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c \\nand d) Hillshade Maps\", hillshade representations are an effective way to visualize the three-\\ndimensional nature of land elevations on a two-dimensional monitor or paper map. Hillshade maps \\ncan also be used effectively as a baseline map when overlain with a semitransparent layer, such as a \\nfalse-color digital elevation model (DEM; part (d) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  207 \\nFigure 8.12 (a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nViewshed analysis is a valuable visualization technique that uses the elevation value of cells in a DEM \\nor TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) to determine those areas that can be seen from one or more \\nspecific location(s) (part (a) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed Maps\"). The viewing \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  208 \\nlocation can be either a point or line layer and can be placed at any desired elevation. The output of \\nthe viewshed analysis is a binary raster that classifies cells as either 1 (visible) or 0 (not visible). In \\nthe case of two viewing locations, the output raster values would be 2 (visible from both points), 1 \\n(visible from one point), or 0 (not visible from either point). \\nAdditional parameters influencing the resultant viewshed map are the viewing azimuth (horizontal \\nand/or vertical) and viewing radius. The horizontal viewing azimuth is the horizontal angle of the \\nview area and is set to a default value of 360\u00b0. The user may want to change this value to 90\u00b0 if, for \\nexample, the desired viewshed included only the area that could be seen from an office window. \\nSimilarly, vertical viewing angle can be set from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. Finally, the viewing radius determines \\nthe distance from the viewing location that is to be included in the output. This parameter is \\nnormally set to infinity (functionally, this includes all areas within the DEM or TIN under \\nexamination). It may be decreased if, for instance, you only wanted to include the area within the 100 \\nkm broadcast range of a radio station. \\nSimilarly, watershed analyses are a series of surface analysis techniques that define the topographic \\ndivides that drain surface water for stream networks (part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) \\nWatershed Maps\"). In geographic information systems (GISs), a watershed analysis is based on input \\nof a \u201cfilled\u201d DEM. A filled DEM is one that contains no internal depressions (such as would be seen \\nin a pothole, sink wetland, or quarry). From these inputs, a flow direction raster is created to model \\nthe direction of water movement across the surface. From the flow direction information, a flow \\naccumulation raster calculates the number of cells that contribute flow to each cell. Generally \\nspeaking, cells with a high value of flow accumulation represent stream channels, while cells with \\nlow flow accumulation represent uplands. With this in mind, a network of rasterized stream \\nsegments is created. These stream networks are based on some user-defined minimum threshold of \\nflow accumulation. For example, it may be decided that a cell needs at least one thousand \\ncontributing cells to be considered a stream segment. Altering this threshold value will change the \\ndensity of the stream network. Following the creation of the stream network, a stream link raster is \\ncalculated whereby each stream segment (line) is topologically connected to stream intersections \\n(nodes). Finally, the flow direction and stream link raster datasets are combined to determine the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  209 \\noutput watershed raster as seen in part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed \\nMaps\" (Chang 2008).

This chapter is concerned less with the \\ncomputational options available to the GIS user and more with the artistic options. In essence, this \\nchapter shifts the focus away from GIS tools and toward cartographic tools, although the two are \\nbecoming more and more inextricably bound. Unfortunately, many GIS users are never exposed to \\nthe field of cartography. In these cases, the hard work of creating, maintaining, aligning, and \\nanalyzing complex spatial datasets are not truly appreciated as the final mapping product may not \\nadequately communicate this information to the consumer. In addition, maps, like statistics, can be \\nused to distort information, as illustrated by Mark Monmonier\u2019s (1996) [1] book titled How to Lie with \\nMaps. Indeed, a strong working knowledge of cartographic rules will not only assist in the avoidance \\nof potential misrepresentation of spatial information but also enhance one\u2019s ability to identify these \\nindiscretions in other cartographers\u2019 creations. The cartographic principles discussed herein are laid \\nout to guide GIS users through the process of transforming accumulated bits of GIS data into \\nattractive, useful maps for print and display. This discussion specifically addresses the intricacies of \\neffective color usage (Section 9.1 \"Color\"), symbol selection (Section 9.2 \"Symbology\"), and map \\nlayout and design (Section 9.3 \"Cartographic Design\"). \\n \\n[1] Monmonier, M. 1996.

The objective of this section is to gain an understanding the properties of color and how best to utilize \\nthem in your cartographic products. \\nAlthough a high-quality map is composed of many different elements, color is one of the first \\ncomponents noticed by end-users. This is partially due to the fact that we each have an intuitive \\nunderstanding of how colors are, and should be, used to create an effective and pleasing visual \\nexperience. Nevertheless, it is not always clear to the map-maker which colors should be used to best \\nconvey the purpose of the product. This intuition is much like listening to our favorite music. We \\nknow when a note is in tune or out of tune, but we wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any idea of how to fix a \\nbad note. Color is indeed a tricky piece of the cartographic puzzle and is not surprisingly the most \\nfrequently criticized variable on computer-generated maps (Monmonier 1996). [1] This section \\nattempts to outline the basic components of color and the guidelines to most effectively employ this \\nimportant map attribute. \\nColor Basics \\nAs electromagnetic radiation (ER) travels via waves from the sun (or a lightbulb) to objects on the earth, \\nportions of the ER spectrum are absorbed, scattered, or reflected by various objects. The resulting \\nproperty of the absorbed, scattered, and reflected ER is termed \u201ccolor.\u201d White is the color resulting from \\nthe full range of the visual spectrum and is therefore considered the benchmark color by which all others \\nare measured. Black is the absence of ER. All other colors result from a partial interaction with the ER \\nspectrum. \\nThe three primary aspects of color that must be addressed in map making are hue, value, and \\nsaturation. Hue is the dominant wavelength or color associated with a reflecting object. Hue is the most \\nbasic component of color and includes red, blue, yellow, purple, and so forth.  Value is the amount of white \\nor black in the color. Value is often synonymous with contrast. Variations in the amount of value for a \\ngiven hue result in varying degrees of lightness or darkness for that color. Lighter colors are said to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  212 \\npossess high value, while dark colors possess low value. Monochrome colors are groups of colors with the \\nsame hue but with incremental variations in value. As seen in , variations in value will typically lead the \\nviewer\u2019s eye from dark areas to light areas. \\nFigure 9.1 Value \\n \\nSaturation describes the intensity of color. Full saturation results in pure colors, while low saturation \\ncolors approach gray. Variations in saturation yield different shades and tints.  Shades are produced by \\nblocking light, such as by an umbrella, tree, curtain, and so forth. Increasing the amount of shading \\nresults in grays and blacks. Tint is the opposite of shade and is produced by adding white to a color. Tints \\nand shades are particularly germane when using additive color models (see for more on additive color \\nmodels). To maximize the interpretability of a map, use saturated colors to represent hierarchically \\nprominent features and washed-out colors to represent background features. \\nIf used properly, color can greatly enhance and support map design. Likewise, color can detract from a \\nmapping product if abused. To use color properly, one must first consider the purpose of the map. In \\nsome cases, the use of color is not warranted. Grayscale maps can be just as effective as color maps if the \\nsubject matter merits it. Regardless, there are many reasons to use color. The five primary reasons are \\noutlined here. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  213 \\nColor is particularly suited to convey meaning (). For example, red is a strong color that evokes a \\npassionate response in humans. Red has been shown to evoke physiological responses such as increasing \\nthe rate of respiration and raising blood pressure. Red is frequently associated with blood , war, violence, \\neven love. On the other hand, blue is a color associated with calming effects. Associated with the sky or \\nocean, blue colors can actually assist in sleep and is therefore a recommended color for bedrooms. Too \\nmuch blue, however, can result in a lapse from calming effects into feelings of depression (i.e., having the \\n\u201cblues\u201d). Green is most commonly associated with life or nature (plants). The color green is certainly one \\nof the most topical colors in today\u2019s society with commonplace references to green construction, the Green \\nparty, going green, and so forth. Green, however, can also represent envy and inexperience (e.g., the \\ngreen-eyed monster, greenhorn). Brown is also a nature color but more as a representation of earth and \\nstone. Brown can also imply dullness. Yellow is most commonly associated with sunshine and warmth, \\nsomewhat similar to red. Yellow can also represent cowardice (e.g., yellow -bellied). Black, the absence of \\ncolor, is possibly the most meaning-laden color in modern parlance. Even more than the others, the color \\nblack purports surprisingly strong positive and negative connotations. Black conveys mystery, elegance, \\nand sophistication (e.g., a black-tie affair, in the black), while also conveying loss, evil, and negativity (e .g., \\nblackout, black-hearted, black cloud, blacklist). \\nFigure 9.2 Use of Color to Provide Meaning \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  214 \\nIn this map, red counties are those that voted for the Republican Party in the 2004 presidential \\nelection, while blue counties voted Democrat. These colors are typically used to designate the \\nDemocratic and Republican Parties. \\nThe second reason to use color is for clarification and emphasis (). Warm colors, such as reds and yellows, \\nare notable for emphasizing spatial features. These colors will often jump of f the page and are usually the \\nfirst to attract the reader\u2019s eye, particularly if they are counterbalanced with cool colors, such as blues and \\ngreens (see for more on warm and cool colors). In addition, the use of a hue with high saturation will \\nstand out starkly against similar hues of low saturation. \\nFigure 9.3 Use of Color to Provide Emphasis \\n \\nRed marks the spot! \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  215 \\nColor use is also important for creating a map with pleasing aesthetics (). Certainly, one of the most \\nchallenging aspects of map creation is developing an effective color palette. When looking at maps \\nthrough an aesthetic lens, we are truly starting to think of our creations as artwork. Although somewhat \\nparticular to individual viewers, we all have an innate understanding of when colors in a g raphic/art are \\naesthetically pleasing and when they are not. For example, color use is considered harmonious when \\ncolors from opposite sides of the color wheel are used (), whereas equitable use of several major hues can \\ncreate an unbalanced image. \\nFigure 9.4 Use of Color to Provide Aesthetics \\n \\nThe fourth use of color is abstraction (). Color abstraction is an effective way to illustrate quantitative and \\nqualitative data, particularly for thematic products such as choropleth maps. Here, colors are used sol ely \\nto denote different values for a variable and may not have any particular rhyme or reason.  shows a typical \\nthematic map with abstract colors representing different countries.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  216 \\nFigure 9.5 Use of Color to Provide Abstraction \\n \\nOpposite abstraction, color can also be used to represent reality (). Maps showing elevation (e.g., digital \\nelevation models or DEMs) are often given false colors that approximate reality. Low areas are colored in \\nvariations of green to show areas of lush vegetation growth. Mid-elevations (or low-lying desert areas) are \\ncolored brown to show sparse vegetation growth. Mountain ridges and peaks are colored white to show \\naccumulated snowfall. Watercourses and water bodies are colored blue. Unless there is a specific reason \\nnot to, natural phenomena represented on maps should always be colored to approximate their actual \\ncolor to increase interpretability and to decrease confusion. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  217 \\nFigure 9.6 \\n3\\n \\nGreens, blues, and browns are used to imitate real-world phenomena. \\nColor Models \\nColor models are systems that allow for the creation of a range of colors from a short list of primary \\ncolors. Color models can be additive or subtractive. Additive color models combine emitted light to \\ndisplay color variations and are commonly used with computer monitors, televisions, scanners, digital \\ncameras, and video projectors. The RGB (red-green-blue) color model is the most common additive model \\n(part (a) of ). The RGB model combines light beams of the primary hues of red, green, and blue to yield \\nadditive secondary hues of magenta, cyan, and yellow. Although there is a substantive difference between \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  218 \\npure yellow light (~580 nm) and a mixture of green and red light, the human eye perceives these signals \\nas the same. The RGB model typically employs three 8-bit numeric values (called an RGB triplet) ranging \\nfrom 0 to 255 to model colors. For instance, the RGB triplets for the pure primary and secondary colors \\nare as follows: \\n\u2022 Red = (255, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 Green = (0, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Blue = (0, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Magenta = (255, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Cyan = (0, 255, 255) \\n\u2022 Yellow = (255, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Black, the absence of additive color = (0, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 White, the sum of all additive color = (255, 255, 255) \\nTwo other common additive color models, based on the RGB model, are the HSL  (hue, saturation, \\nlightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, value) models (, b and c). These models are based on cylindrical \\ncoordinate systems whereby the angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to the hue; the \\ndistance from the central axis corresponds to saturation; and the distance along the central axis \\ncorresponds to either saturation or lightness. Because of their basis in the RGB model, both the HSL and \\nHSV color models can be directly transformed between the three additive models. While these relatively \\nsimple additive models provide minimal computer-processing time, they do possess the disadvantage of \\nglossing over some of the complexities of color. For example, the RGB color model does not define \\n\u201cabsolute\u201d color spaces, which connotes that these hues may look differently when viewed on different \\ndisplays. Also, the RGB hues are not evenly spaced along the color spectrum, meaning combinations of \\nthe hues is less than exact. \\nFigure 9.7 Additive Color Models: (a) RGB, (b) HSL, and (c) HSV \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  219 \\nIn contrast to an additive model, subtractive color models involve the mixing of paints, dyes, or inks to \\ncreate full color ranges. These subtractive models display color on the assumption that white, ambient \\nlight is being scattered, absorbed, and reflected from the page by the pri nting inks. Subtractive models \\ntherefore create white by restricting ink from the print surface. As such, these models assume the use of \\nwhite paper as other paper colors will result in skewed hues. CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is the \\nmost common subtractive color model and is occasionally referred to as a \u201cfour-color process\u201d (). \\nAlthough the CMY inks are sufficient to create all of the colors of the subtractive rainbow, a black ink is \\nincluded in this model as it is much cheaper than using a CMY mix for all blacks (black being the most \\ncommonly printed color) and because combining CMY often results in more of a dark brown hue. The \\nCMYK model creates color values by entering percentages for each of the four colors ranging from 0 \\npercent to 100 percent. For example, pure red is composed of 14 percent cyan, 100 percent magenta, 99 \\npercent yellow, and 3 percent black. \\nAs you may guess, additive models are the preferred choice when maps are to be displayed on a computer \\nmonitor, while subtractive models are preferred when printing. If in doubt, it is usually best to use the \\nRGB model as this supports a larger percentage of the visible spectrum in comparison with the CMYK \\nmodel. Once an image is converted from RGB to CMYK, the additional RGB information is irretrievably \\nlost. If possible, collecting both RGB and CMYK versions of an image is ideal, particularly if your graphic \\nis to be both printed and placed online. One last note, you will also want to be selective in your use of file \\nformats for these color models. The JPEG and GIF graphic file formats are the best choice for RGB \\nimages, while the EPS and TIFF graphic file formats are preferred with printed CMYK images.  \\nFigure 9.8 Subtractive Color Model: CMYK \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  220 \\nColor Choices \\nEffective color usage requires a modicum of knowledge about the color wheel. Invented by Sir Isaac \\nNewton in 1706, the color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic \\nrelationships. Primary hues are equidistant from each other with secondary and tertiary colors \\nintervening. The red-yellow-blue color wheel is the most frequently used (); however, the magenta -yellow-\\ncyan wheel is the preferred choice of print makers (for reasons described in the previous section). Primary \\ncolors are those that cannot be created by mixing other colors; secondary colors are defined as those \\ncolors created by mixing two primary hues; tertiary colors are those created by mixing primary and \\nsecondary hues. Furthermore, complementary colors are those placed opposite each on t he wheel, while \\nanalogous colors are located proximal to each other. Complementary colors emphasize differences. \\nAnalogues suggest harmony. \\nFigure 9.9 Color Wheel Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  221 \\n \\nColors can be further referred to as warm or cool (). Warm colors are those that might be seen during a \\nbright, sunny day. Cool colors are those associated with overcast days. Warm colors are typified by hues \\nranging from red to yellow, including browns and tans. Cool color hues range from blue -green through \\nblue-violet and include the majority of gray variants. When used in mapping, it is wise to use warm and \\ncool colors with care. Indeed, warm colors stand out, appear active, and stimulate the viewer. Cool colors \\nappear small, recede, and calm the viewer. As you might guess, it is important th at you apply warm colors \\nto the map features of primary interest, while using cool colors on the secondary, background, and/or \\ncontextual features. \\nFigure 9.10 Warm (Orange) and Cool (Blue) Colors \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  222 \\n \\nNote that the warm color stands out, while the cool color recedes. \\nIn light of the plethora of color schemes and options available, it is wise to follow some basic color usage \\nguidelines. For example, changes in hue are best suited to visualizing qualitative data, while changes in \\nvalue and saturation are effective at visualizing quantitative data. Likewise, variations in lightness and \\nsaturation are best suited to representing ordered data since these establish hierarchy among features. In \\nparticular, a monochromatic color scale is an effective way to represent the order of data whereby light \\ncolors represent smaller data values and dark colors represent larger values. Keep in mind that it is best to \\nuse more light shades than dark ones as the human eye can better discern lighter shades. Also, the \\nnumber of coincident colors that can be distinguished by humans is around seven, so be careful not to \\nabuse the color palette in your maps. If the data being mapped has a zero point, a dichromatic scale () \\nprovides a natural breaking point with increasing color values on each end of the scale representing \\nincreasing data values. \\nFigure 9.11 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  223 \\n \\nA dichromatic scale is essentially two monochromatic scales joined by a low color value in the \\ncenter. \\nIn addition, darker colors result in more important or pronounced graphic featu res (assuming the \\nbackground is not overly dark). Use dark colors on features whose visual impact you wish to magnify. \\nFinally, do not use all the colors of the spectrum in a single map. It is best to leave such messy, rainbow -\\nspectacular effects to the late Jackson Pollock and his abstract expressionist ilk. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Colors are defined by their hue, value, saturation, shade, and tint. \\n\u2022 Colors are used to convey meaning, clarification and emphasis, aesthetics, abstraction, and reality.  \\n\u2022 Color models can be additive (e.g., RGB) or subtractive (e.g., CMYK). \\n\u2022 The color wheel is a powerful tool that assists in the selection of colors for your cartographic products.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how to best utilize point, line, and polygon symbols to assist \\nin the interpretation of your map and its features. \\nWhile color is an integral variable when choosing how to best represent spatial data, making \\ninformed decisions on the size, shape, and type of symbols is equally important. Although raster data \\nare restricted to symbolizing features as a single cell or as cell groupings, vector data allows for a vast \\narray of options to symbolize points, lines, and polygons in a map. Like color, cartographers must \\ntake care to use symbols judiciously in order to most effectively communicate the meaning and \\npurpose of the map to the viewer. \\nBasic Symbol Guidelines \\nVector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a myriad of ways. The guidelines laid out in this \\nsection will help you to make informed decisions on how best to represent the features in your map. The \\nprimary visual variables associated with symbolization include size, texture, pattern, and shape ( Figure \\n9.12 \"Visual Variables\"). Changes to symbol size and texture are most effectively used in conjunction with \\nordinal, interval, and ratio data. Changes to symbol pattern and shape are preferred in conjunction with \\nnominal data. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  225 \\nFigure 9.12 Visual Variables \\n \\nVariations in the size of symbols are powerful indicators of feature importance. Intuitively, larger symbols \\nare assumed to be more important than smaller symbols. Although symbol size is most commonly \\nassociated with point features, linear symbols can effectively be altered in size by adjusting line width. \\nPolygon features can also benefit from resizing. Despite the fact that the area of the polygon can\u2019t be \\nchanged, a point representing the centroid of the polygon can be included in the map. These polygon \\ncentroids can be resized and symbolized as desired, just like any other point feature. Varying symbol size \\nis moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is ineffective with nominal data.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  226 \\nSymbol texture, also referred to as spacing, refers to the compactness of the marks that make up the \\nsymbol. Points, lines, and polygons can be filled with horizontal hash marks, for instance. The closer these \\nhash marks are spaced within the feature symbol, the more hierarchically important the feature will \\nappear. Varying symbol texture is most effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is \\nineffective with nominal data. \\nMuch like texture, symbols can be filled with different patterns. These patterns are typically some artistic \\nabstraction that may or may not attempt to visualize real-world phenomena. For example, a land-use map \\nmay change the observed fill patterns of various land types to try to depict the dominant plants associated \\nwith each vegetation community. Changes to symbol patterns are most often associated with polygon \\nfeatures, although there is some limited utility in changing the fill patterns of points and lines. Varying \\nsymbol size is moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data and is ineffective when \\napplied to nominal data. \\nAltering symbol shape can have dramatic effects on the appearance of map features. Point symbols are \\nmost commonly symbolized with circles. Circles tend to be the default point symbol due to their \\nunchanging orientation, compact shape, and viewer preference. Other geometric shapes can also \\nconstitute effective symbols due to their visual stability and conservation of map space. Unless specific \\nconditions allow, volumetric symbols (spheres, cubes, etc.) should be used sparingly as they rarely \\ncontribute more than simple, two-dimensional symbols. In addition to geometric symbols, pictograms are \\nuseful representations of point features and can help to add artistic flair to a map. Pictograms should \\nclearly denote features of interest and should not require interpretation by the viewer ( Figure 9.13 \\n\"Pictograms\"). Locales that frequently employ pictograms include picnic areas, camping sites, road signs, \\nbathrooms, airports, and so forth. Varying symbol shape is most effective when applied to nominal data \\nand is moderately effective with ordinal and nominal data. \\nFinally, applying variations in lightness/darkness will affect the hierarchical value of a symbol. The darker \\nthe symbol, the more it stands out among lighter features. Variations in the lightness/darkness of a \\nsymbol are most effective when applied to ordinal data, are moderately effective when applied to \\nnumerical data, and are ineffective when applied to nominal data.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  227 \\nFigure 9.13 Pictograms \\n \\nKeep in mind that there are many other visual variables that can be employed in a map, depending on the \\ncartographic software used. Regardless of the chosen symbology, it is important to maintain a logical \\nrelationship between the symbol and the data. Also, visual contrast between different mapped variables \\nmust be preserved. Indeed, the efficacy of your map will be greatly diminished if you do not ensure that its \\nsymbols are readily identifiable and look markedly different from each other.  \\nProportional Symbolization \\nIn addition to the uniform symbols presented in the previous section, symbols for a single, q uantitative \\nvariable can be sized proportionally to match the data values. These proportional symbols are useful for \\npresenting a fairly exact understanding of the differences in magnitude within a dataset. As the numeric \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  228 \\nvalues for each class increases, so too does the size of the symbol representing that class. This allows the \\nsymbol size of features to be directly related to the attribute values they represent whereby small points \\ndenote small data values and large points denote large data values.  \\nSimilar to proportional symbols, range graded symbols group raw data into classes with each class \\nrepresented by a differently sized symbol. Both proportional and range graded symbols are most \\nfrequently used with point data, but lines and polygons can benefit from proportional symbolization as \\nwell. In the case of linear datasets, line width is most frequently used as the proportional visual variable. \\nPolygon datasets typically summarize a quantitative variable within each polygon, place a centroid within \\nthat polygon, and proportion that centroid point symbol. Range grading should not be used if the data \\nrange for a given variable is small. In these cases, range grading will suggest larger differences in the data \\nvalues than is merited. \\nThe advantage of proportional symbolization is the ease with which the viewer can discriminate symbol \\nsize and thus understand variations in the data values over a given map extent. On the other hand, \\nviewers may misjudge the magnitude of the proportional symbols if they do not pa y close attention to the \\nlegend. In addition, the human eye does not see and interpret symbol size in absolute terms. When \\nproportional circles are used in maps, it is typical that the viewer will underestimate the larger circles \\nrelative to the smaller circles. To address this potential pitfall, graduated symbols can be based on either \\nmathematical or perceptual scaling. Mathematical scaling directly relates symbol size with the data value \\nfor that locale. If one value is twice as large as another, it will be represented with a symbol twice as large \\nas the other. Perceptual scaling overcomes the underestimation of large symbols by making these symbols \\nmuch larger than their actual value would indicate (Figure 9.14 \"Mathematical versus Perceptual \\nScaling\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  229 \\nFigure 9.14 Mathematical versus Perceptual Scaling \\n \\nA disadvantage of proportional symbolization is that the symbol size can appear variable depending on \\nthe surrounding symbols. This is best shown via the Ebbinghaus illusion (also known as Titchener \\ncircles). As you can see in Figure 9.15 \"Ebbinghaus Illusion\", the central circles are both the same size but \\nappear different due to the visual influence of the surrounding circles. If you are creating a graphic with \\nmany different symbols, this illusion can wreak havoc on the interpretability of your map.  \\nFigure 9.15 Ebbinghaus Illusion \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  230 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a variety of ways.

The objective of this section is to familiarize cartographers with the basic cartographic principles that \\ncontribute to effective map design. \\nIn addition to effective use of colors and symbols, a map that is well designed will greatly enhance its \\nability to relate pertinent spatial information to the viewer. Judicious use of map elements, \\ntypography/labels, and design principles will result in maps that minimize confusion and maximize \\ninterpretability. Furthermore, the use of these components must be guided by a keen understanding \\nof the map\u2019s purpose, intended audience, topic, scale, and production/reproduction method. \\nMap Elements \\nChapter 9 \"Cartographic Principles\", Section 9.1 \"Color\" and Section 9.2 \"Symbology\" discussed visual \\nvariables specific to the spatial features of a map. However, a map is composed of many more elements \\nthan just the spatial features, each of which contributes immensely to the interpretability and flow of the \\noverall map. This section outlines the basic map elements that should be incorporated into a \u201ccomplete\u201d \\nmap. Following Slocum et al. (2005), [1] these elements are listed in the logical order in which they should \\nbe placed into the map (Figure 9.16 \"A US Map Showing Various Map Elements\"). \\nThe first feature that should be placed into the map layout is the frame line. This line is essentially a \\nbordering box that surrounds all the map elements described hereafter. All of these map elements should \\nbe balanced within the frame line. To balance a map, ensure that neither large blank spaces nor jumbled \\nmasses of information are present within the map. Similar to frame lines are  neat lines. Neat lines are \\nborder boxes that are placed around individual map elements. By definition, neat lines must occu r within \\nthe frame line. Both frame lines and neat lines are typically thin, black -lined boxes, but they can be altered \\nto match the specific aesthetics of an individual map. \\nThe mapped area is the primary geographic component of the overall map. The mapped area contains all \\nof the features and symbols used to represent the spatial phenomena being displayed. The mapped area is \\ntypically bordered with a neat line. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  232 \\nInsets can be thought of as secondary map areas, each encased within their own neat line. These  neat lines \\nshould be of different thickness or type than other line features on the map to adequately demarcate them \\nfrom other map features. Insets often display the primary mapped area in relation to a larger area. For \\nexample, if the primary map shows the locales of national parks with a county, an inset displaying the \\nlocation of that county within the larger state boundary may be included. Conversely, insets are also used \\nto display areas related to the primary map but that occur at some far off local e. This type of inset is often \\nused with maps of the United States whereby Alaska and Hawaii are placed as insets to a map of the \\ncontiguous United States. Finally, insets can be used to clarify areas where features would otherwise be \\novercrowded if restricted to the primary mapping area. If the county map of national parks contained four \\nsmall, adjacent parks, an inset could be used to expand that jumbled portion of the map to show the exact \\nspatial extent of each of the four parks. This type of inset is frequently seen when showing the small \\nnortheastern states on a map of the entire United States. \\nAll maps should have a title. The title is one of the first map elements to catch the viewer\u2019s eye, so care \\nshould be taken to most effectively represent the intent of the map with this leading text. The title should \\nclearly and concisely explain the purpose of the map and should specifically target the intended viewing \\naudience. When overly verbose or cryptically abbreviated, a poor title will detract immensely from the \\ninterpretability of the cartographic end-product. The title should contain the largest type on the map and \\nbe limited to one line, if possible. It should be placed at the top-center of the map unless there is a specific \\nreason otherwise. An alternate locale for the title is directly above the legend. \\nThe legend provides a self-explanatory definition for all symbols used within the mapped area. Care must \\nbe taken when developing this map element, as a multitude of features within a dataset can lead to an \\noverly complex legend. Although placement of the legend is variable, it should be placed within the white \\nspace of the map and not in such a way that it masks any other map elements. Atop the legend box is the \\noptional legend header. The legend header should not simply repeat the information from the title, nor \\nshould it include extraneous, non-legend-specific information. The symbols representing mapped features \\nshould be to the left of the explanatory text. Placing a neat line around the legend will help to bring \\nattention to the element and is recommended but not required. Be careful not to take up too much of the \\nmap with the legend, while also not making the legend so small that it becomes difficult to read or that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  233 \\nsymbols become cluttered. Removing information related to base map features (e.g., state boundaries on a \\nUS map) or readily identifiable features (e.g., highway or interstate symbols) is one effective way to \\nminimize legend size. If a large legend is unavoidable, it is acceptable to plac e this feature outside of the \\nmap\u2019s frame line. \\nAttribution of the data source within the map allows users to assess from where the data are derived. \\nStylistically, the data source attribution should be hierarchically minimized by using a relatively small,  \\nsimple font. It is also helpful to preface this map element with \u201cSource:\u201d to avoid confusion with other \\ntypographic elements. \\nAn indicator of scale is invaluable to provide viewers with the means to properly adjudicate the \\ndimensions of the map. While not as important when mapping large or widely familiar locales such as a \\ncountry or continent, the scale element allows viewers to measure distances on the map. The three \\nprimary representations of scale are the representational fraction, verbal scale, and b ar scale (for more, \\nsee Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.1 \"Maps and Map Types\"). The scale indicator should not be \\nprominently displayed within the map as this element is of secondary importance.  \\nFinally, map orientation notifies the viewer of the direction of the map. To assist in clarifying orientation, \\na graticule can also be included in the mapped area. Most maps are made such that the top of the page \\npoints to the north (i.e., a north-up map). If your map is not north-up, there should be a good reason for \\nit. Orientation is most often indicated with a north arrow, of which there are many stylistic options \\navailable in current geographic information system (GIS) software packages. One of the most commonly \\nencountered map errors is the use of an overly large or overly ornate north arrow. North arrows should be \\nfairly inconspicuous as they only need to be viewed once by the reader. Ornate north arrows can be used \\non small scale maps, but simple north arrows are preferred on medium to large- scale maps so as to not \\ndetract from the presumably more important information appearing elsewhere.  \\nTaken together, these map elements should work together to achieve the goal of a clear, ordered, \\nbalanced, and unified map product. Since modern GIS packages allow users to add and remove these \\ngraphic elements with little effort, care must be taken to avoid the inclination to employ these Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  234 \\ncomponents with as little forethought as it takes to create them. The following sections provide further \\nguidance on composing these elements on the page to honor and balance the mapped area.  \\nFigure 9.16 A US Map Showing Various Map Elements \\n \\nTypography and Label Placement \\nType is found throughout all the elements of a map. Type is similar to map symbols in many senses. \\nColoring effects alter typographic hierarchy as lighter type fades into the background and dark type jumps \\nto the fore. Using all uppercase letters and/or bolded letters will result in more pronounced textual \\neffects. Larger font sizes increase the hierarchical weight of the type, so ensure that the size of the type \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  235 \\ncorresponds with the importance of the map feature. Use decorative fonts, bold, and italics sparingly. \\nThese fonts, as well as overly small fonts, can be difficult to read if overused. Most importantly, always \\nspell check your final cartographic product. After spell checking, spell check again. Yu wont reegrett teh \\necstra efort. \\nOther typographic options for altering text include the use of serif, sans serif, and display fonts. While the \\nuse of serif fonts are preferred in written documents to provide horizontal guidelines, either is acceptable \\nin a mapping application (Slocum 2005). [2] Sans serif fonts, on the other hand, are preferred for maps \\nthat are viewed over the Internet. \\nKerning is an effective typographic effect that alters the space between adjacent letters in a word. \\nDecreasing the kerning of a typeset is useful if the text is too large for the space given. Alternatively, \\nincreasing the kerning is an effective way to label large map areas, par ticularly in conjunction with all-\\nuppercase lettering. Like kerning, changes in leading (pronounced \u201cled-ing\u201d) alter the vertical distance \\nbetween lines of text. Leading should not be so cramped that lines of text begin to overwrite each other, \\nnor should it be so wide that lines of text appear unrelated. Other common typographic effects include \\nmasks, callouts, shadows, and halos (Figure 9.17 \"Typographic Effects\"). All of these effects serve to \\nincrease the visibility and importance of the text to which they are applied.  \\nFigure 9.17 Typographic Effects \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  236 \\nIn addition to the general typographic guidelines discussed earlier, there are specific typographic \\nsuggestions for feature labels. Obviously, labels must be placed proximal to their symbols so they are \\ndirectly and readily associated with the features they describe. Labels should maintain a consistent \\norientation throughout so the reader does not have to rubberneck about to read various entries. Also, \\navoid overprinting labels on top of other graphics or typographic features. If that is not possible, consider \\nusing a halo, mask, callout, or shadow to help the text stand out from the background. In the case of maps \\nwith many symbols, be sure that no features intervene between a symbol and its label.  \\nSome typographic guidelines are specific to labels for point, line, and polygon features. Point labels, for \\nexample, should not employ exaggerated kerning or leading. If leader lines are used, they should not \\ntouch the point symbol nor should they include arrow heads. Leader lines should always be represented \\nwith consistent color and line thickness throughout the map extent. Lastly, point labels should be placed \\nwithin the larger polygon in which they reside. For example, if the cities of Illinois were being map ped as \\npoints atop a state polygon layer, the label for the Chicago point symbol should occur entirely over land, \\nand not reach into Lake Michigan. As this feature is located entirely on land, so should its label.  \\nLine labels should be placed above their associated features but should not touch them. If the linear \\nfeature is complex and meandering, the label should follow the general trend of the feature and not \\nattempt to match the alignment of each twist and turn. If the linear feature is particularly lon g, the feature \\ncan be labeled multiple times across its length. Line labels should always read from left to right.  \\nPolygon labels should be placed within the center of the feature whenever possible. If increased emphasis \\nis desired, all-uppercase letters can be effective. If all-uppercase letters are used, exaggerated kerning and \\nleading is also appropriate to increase the hierarchical importance of the feature. If the polygon feature is \\ntoo small to include text, label the feature as if it were a point symbol. Unlike point labels, however, leader \\nlines should just enter into the feature. \\nMap Design Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  237 \\nMap design is a complex process that provides many variables and choices to the cartographer. The \\nBritish Cartographic Society Design Group presented five \u201cPrinciples of Cartographic Design\u201d on their \\nlistserv on November 26, 1999. These principles, and a brief summary of each, are as follows:  \\n1. Concept before compilation. A basic understanding of the concept and purpose of the map \\nmust be secured before the actual mapping exercise begins. Furthermore, there is no way to \\ndetermine what information to include in a map without having first determined who the end-\\nuser is and in what manner the map will be used. A map without a purpose is of no use to anyone.  \\n2. Hierarchy with harmony. Important map features must appear prominent on the map. The \\nless important features should fade into the background. Creating harmony between the primary \\nand secondary representations on the map will lead to a quality product that will best su it the \\nneeds for which it was developed. \\n3. Simplicity from sacrifice. Upon creating a map, it is tempting to add as much information \\ninto the graphic view as can possibly fit. In reality, it is best to leave some stones unturned. Just as \\nthe key to good communication is brevity, it can be said that the key to good mapping is \\nsimplicity. A map can be considered complete when no other features can be removed. Less, in \\nthis instance, is more. \\n4. Maximum information at minimum cost. The purpose of a map is to convey the greatest \\namount of information with the least amount of interpretive effort by the user. Map design should \\nallow complex spatial relationships to be understood at a glance. \\n5. Engage the emotion to engage the understanding. Well-constructed maps are basically \\nworks of art. All of the artistic and aesthetic rules outlined in this chapter serve to engage the \\nemotive center of the viewer. If the viewer does not formulate some basic, emotional response to \\nthe map, the message will be lost. \\nIt should become increasingly clear that the cartographic choices made during the mapping process have \\nas much influence on the interpretation of a map as does the data being mapped. Borrowing liberally from \\nthe popularized Mark Twain quote, it could be said that, \u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, \\nand maps.\u201d Mapmakers, indeed, have the ability to use (or misuse) cartographic principles to represent \\n(or misrepresent) the spatial data at their disposal. It is now up to you, the cartographer, to master the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  238 \\ntools presented in this book to harness the power of maps to elucidate and address the spatial issues with \\nwhich you are confronted. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Commonly used map elements include the neat line, frame line, mapped area, inset, title, legend, data \\nsource, scale, and orientation. \\n\u2022 Like symbology, typography and labeling choices have a major impact on the interpretability of your map.  \\n\u2022 Map design is essentially an artistic endeavor based around a handful of cartographic principles. \\nKnowledge of these principles will allow you create maps worth viewing. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Go online and find a map that employs all the map elements described in this chapter.  \\n2. Go online and find two maps that violate at least two different \u201cPrinciples of Cartographic Design.\u201d \\nExplain how you would improve these maps. \\n \\n[1] Slocum, T., R. McMaster, F.

GIS users typically start their careers performing low-end tasks such as digitizing vast \\nanalogue datasets or error checking voluminous metadata files. However, adept cartographers will \\nsoon find themselves promoted through the ranks and possibly into management positions. Here, \\nthey will be tasked with an assortment of business-related activities such as overseeing work groups, \\ninterfacing with clients, creating budgets, and managing workflows. As GISs become increasingly \\ncommon in today\u2019s business world, so too must cartographers become adept at managing GIS \\nprojects to maximize effective work strategies and minimize waste. Similarly, as GIS projects begin to \\ntake on more complex and ambitious goals, GIS project managers will only become more important \\nand integral to address the upcoming challenges of the job at hand. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  240 \\n10.1 Project Management Basics \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to achieve a basic understanding of the role of a project manager in the \\nlifecycle of a GIS project. \\nProject management is a fairly recent professional endeavor that is growing rapidly to keep pace with \\nthe increasingly complex job market. Some readers may equate management with the posting of \\nclich\u00e9d artwork that lines the walls of corporate headquarters across the nation (Figure 10.1). These \\nposters often depict a multitude of parachuters falling arm-in-arm while forming some odd \\ngeometric shape, under which the poster is titled \u201cTeamwork.\u201d Another is a beautiful photo of a \\nlandscape titled, \u201cMotivation.\u201d Clearly, any job that is easy enough that its workers can be motivated \\nby a pretty picture is a job that will either soon be done by computers or shipped overseas. In reality, \\nproper project management is a complex task that requires a broad knowledge base and a variety of \\nskills. \\nFigure 10.1 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  241 \\nManagement is more than posting vapid, buzzword-laden artwork such as this in the office \\nplace. \\nThe Project Management Institute (PMI) Standards Committee describes project management as \\n\u201cthe application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet or \\nexceed stakeholder needs and expectations.\u201d To assist in the understanding and implementation of \\nproject management, PMI has written a book devoted to this subject titled, \u201cA Guide to the Project \\nManagement Body of Knowledge,\u201d also known as the PMBOK Guide (PMI 2008). This section guides \\nthe reader through the basic tenets of this text. \\nThe primary stakeholders in a given project include the project manager, project team, sponsor/client, \\nand customer/end-user. As project manager, you will be required to identify and solve potential \\nproblems, issues, and questions as they arise. Although much of this section is applicable to the \\nmajority of information technology (IT) projects, GIS projects are particularly challenging due to the \\nlarge storage, integration, and performance requirements associated with this particular field. GIS \\nprojects, therefore, tend to have elevated levels of risk compared to standard IT projects. \\nProject management is an integrative effort whereby all of the project\u2019s pieces must be aligned \\nproperly for timely completion of the work. Failure anywhere along the project timeline will result in \\ndelay, or outright failure, of the project goals. To accomplish this daunting task, \\nfive process groups and nine project management knowledge areas have been developed to meet \\nproject objectives. These process groups and knowledge areas are described in this section. \\nPMBOK Process Groups \\nThe five project management process groups presented here are described separately, but realize that \\nthere is typically a large degree of overlap among each of them.  \\nInitiation, the first process group, defines and authorizes a particular project o r project phase. This is the \\npoint at which the scope, available resources, deliverables, schedule, and goals are decided. Initiation is \\ntypically out of the hands of the project management team and, as such, requires a high -level \\nsponsor/client to approve a given course of action. This approval comes to the project manager in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  242 \\nform of a project charter that provides the authority to utilize organizational resources to address the \\nissues at hand. \\nThe planning process group determines how a newly initiated project phase will be carried out. It focuses \\non defining the project scope, gathering information, reviewing available resources, identifying and \\nanalyzing potential risks, developing a management plan, and estimating timetables and costs. As such, \\nall stakeholders should be involved in the planning process group to ensure comprehensive feedback. The \\nplanning process is also iterative, meaning that each planning step may positively or negatively affect \\nprevious decisions. If changes need to be made during these iterations, the project manager must revisit \\nthe plan components and update those now-obsolete activities. This iterative methodology is referred to \\nas \u201crolling wave planning.\u201d \\nThe executing process group describes those processes employed to compl ete the work outlined in the \\nplanning process group. Common activities performed during this process group include directing project \\nexecution, acquiring and developing the project team, performing quality assurance, and distributing \\ninformation to the stakeholders. The executing process group, like the planning process group, is often \\niterative due to fluctuations in project specifics (e.g., timelines, productivity, unanticipated risk) and \\ntherefore may require reevaluation throughout the lifecycle of the project. \\nThe monitoring and controlling process group is used to observe the project, identify potential problems, \\nand correct those problems. These processes run concurrently with all of the other process groups and \\ntherefore span the entire project lifecycle. This process group examines all proposed changes to the \\nproject and approves only those that do not alter the overall, stated goals of the project. Some of the \\nspecific activities and actions monitored and controlled by this process group include the  project scope, \\nschedule, cost, output quality, reports, risk, and stakeholder interactions.  \\nFinally, the closing process group essentially terminates all of the actions and activities undertaken during \\nthe four previous process groups. This process group includes handing off all pertinent deliverables to the \\nproper recipients and the formal completion of all contracts with the sponsor/client. This process group is \\nalso important to signal the sponsor/client that no more charges will be made, and they can n ow reassign \\nthe project staff and organizational resources as needed. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  243 \\nPMBOK Project Management Knowledge Areas \\nEach of the five aforementioned process groups is available for use with nine different knowledge areas. \\nThese knowledge areas comprise those subjects that project managers must be familiar with to \\nsuccessfully complete a given project. A brief description of each of these nine knowledge areas is \\nprovided here. \\n1. Project integration management describes the ability of the project manager to \u201cidentify, \\ndefine, combine, unify, and coordinate\u201d the various project activities into a coherent whole \\n(PMBOK 2008). It is understood by senior project managers that there is no single way to \\nsuccessfully complete this task. In reality, each manager must apply their specific skills, \\ntechniques, and knowledge to the job at hand. This knowledge area incorporates all five of the \\nPMBOK process groups. \\n2. Project scope management entails an understanding of not only what work is required to \\ncomplete the project but also what extraneous work should be excluded from project. Defining the \\nscope of a project is usually done via the creation of a scope plan document that is distributed \\namong team members. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n3. Project time management takes into account the fact that all projects are subject to certain \\ntime constraints. These time constraints must be analyzed and an overall pr oject schedule must \\nbe developed based on inputs from all project stakeholders (see Section 10.2.1 \"Scheduling\"  for \\nmore on scheduling). This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n4. Project cost management is focused not only with determining a reasonable budget for each \\nproject task but also with staying within the defined budget. Project cost management is often \\neither very simple or very complex. Particular care needs to be taken to work with th e \\nsponsor/client as they will be funding this effort. Therefore, any changes or augments to the \\nproject costs must be vetted through the sponsor/client prior to initiating those changes. This \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring and controlling process \\ngroups. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  244 \\n5. Project quality management identifies the quality standards of the project and determines \\nhow best to satisfy those standards. It incorporates responsibilities such as quality planning, \\nquality assurance, and quality control. To ensure adequate quality management, the project \\nmanager must evaluate the expectations of the other stakeholders and continually monitor the \\noutput of the various project tasks. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n6. Project human resource management involves the acquisition, development, organization, \\nand oversight of all team members. Managers should attempt to include team members in as \\nmany aspects of the task as possible so they feel loyal to the work and invested in creating the best \\noutput possible. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and \\ncontrolling process groups. \\n7. Project communication management describes those processes required to maintain open \\nlines of communication with the project stakeholders. Included in this knowledge area is the \\ndetermination of who needs to communicate with whom, how communication will be maintained \\n(e-mail, letter reports, phone, etc.), how frequently contacts will be made, what barriers will limit \\ncommunication, and how past communications will be tracked and archived. This knowledge area \\nincorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling process groups.  \\n8. Project risk management identifies and mitigates risk to the project. It is concerned with \\nanalyzing the severity of risk, planning responses, and monitoring those identified risks. Risk \\nanalysis has become a complex undertaking as experienced project managers understand that \u201can \\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d Risk management involves working with all team \\nmembers to evaluate each individual task and to minimize the potential for that risk to manifest \\nitself in the project or deliverable. This knowledge area incorporates the plann ing, as well as the \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n9. Project procurement management, the final knowledge area, outlines the process by which \\nproducts, services, and/or results are acquired from outside the project team. This includes \\nselecting business partners, managing contracts, and closing contracts. These contracts are legal \\ndocuments supported by the force of law. Therefore, the fine print must be read and understood \\nto ensure that no confusion arises between the two parties entering into th e agreement. This Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  245 \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing \\nprocess groups. \\nProject Failure \\nMurphy\u2019s Law of Project Management states that no major project is completed on time, within budget, \\nand with the same staff that started it\u2014 do not expect yours to be the first. It has been estimated that only \\n16 percent of fully implemented information technology projects are completed on time and within budget \\n(The Standish Group International 2000). [1] These failed projects result in an estimated loss of over $81 \\nbillion every year! David Hamil discusses the reasons for these failures in his web feature titled, \u201cYour \\nMission, Should You Choose to Accept It: Project Management Excellence\u201d \\n(http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/features/mesa1). \\nThe first noted cause for project failure is poor planning. Every project must undergo some type of \\nplanning-level feasibility study to determine the purpose of the project and the methodologies employed \\nto complete it. A feasibility study is basically used to determine whether or not a project should be given \\nthe \u201cgreen light.\u201d It outlines the project mission, goals, objectives, scope, and constraints. A project may \\nbe deemed unfeasible for a variety of reasons including an unacceptable level of risk, unclear project \\nrequirements, disagreement among clients regarding project objectives, missing key stakeholders, and \\nunresolved political issues. \\nA second cause for project failure is lack of corporate management support. Inadequate staffing and \\nfunding, as well as weak executive sponsorship on the part of the client, will typically result in a project \\nwith little chance of success. One of the most important steps in managing a project will be to determine \\nwhich member of the client\u2019s team is championing your project. This individual, or group of individuals, \\nmust be kept abreast of all major decisions related to the project. If the client\u2019s project champion loses \\ninterest in or contact with the effort, failure is not far afield. \\nA third common cause of project failure is poor project management. A high -level project manager should \\nhave ample experience, education, and leadership abilities, in addition to being a skilled negotiator, \\ncommunicator, problem solver, planner, and organizer. Despite the fact that managers with this wide -Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  246 \\nranging expertise are both uncommon and expensive to maintain, it only takes a failed project or two for a \\nclient to learn the importance of securing the proper person for the job at hand.  \\nThe final cause of project failure is a lack of client focus and the lack of the end -user participation. The \\nclient must be involved in all stages of the lifecycle of the project. More than on e GIS project has been \\ncompleted and delivered to the client, only to discover that the final product was neither what the client \\nenvisioned nor what the client wanted. Likewise, the end-user, which may or may not be the client, is the \\nmost important participant in the long-term survival of the project. The end-user must participate in all \\nstages of project development. The creation of a wonderful GIS tool will most likely go unused if the end -\\nuser can find a better and/or more cost-efficient solution to their needs elsewhere. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Project managers must employ a wide range of activities and actions to achieve the overall goals of the \\nproject. These actions are broken down into five process groups: initiation, planning, executing, \\nmonitoring and controlling, and closing. \\n\u2022 The activities and actions described in this section are applied to nine management knowledge areas that \\nmanagers must be cognizant of to ensure that all the goals of the project will be met: integration \\nmanagement, scope management, time management, cost management, quality management, human \\nresource management, communication management, risk management, and procurement management.  \\n\u2022 Projects can fail for a variety of reasons. Successful managers will be aware of these potential pitfal ls and \\nwill work to overcome them. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. As a student, you are constantly tasked with completing assignments for your classes. Think of one of \\nyour recent assignments as a project that you, as a project (assignment) manager, completed. Describe \\nhow you utilized a sampling of the project management process groups and knowledge areas to complete \\nthat assigned task. \\n \\n[1] The Standish Group International. 2000. \u201cOur Blog.\u201d http://www.pm2go.com. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  247 \\n10.2 GIS Project Management Tools and Techniques \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review a sampling of the common tools and techniques available to \\ncomplete GIS project management tasks. \\nAs a project manager, you will find that there are many tools and techniques that will assist your \\nefforts. While some of these are packaged in a geographic information system (GIS), many are not. \\nOthers are mere concepts that managers must be mindful of when overseeing large projects with a \\nmultitude of tasks, team members, clients, and end-users. This section outlines a sampling of these \\ntools and techniques, although their implementation is dependent on the individual project, scope, \\nand requirements that arise therein. Although these topics could be sprinkled throughout the \\npreceding chapters, they are not concepts whose mastery is typically required of entry-level GIS \\nanalysts or technicians. Rather, they constitute a suite of skills and techniques that are often applied \\nto a project after the basic GIS work has been completed. In this sense, this section is used as a \\nplatform on which to present novice GIS users with a sense of future pathways they may be led down, \\nas well as providing hints to other potential areas of study that will complement their nascent GIS \\nknowledge base. \\nScheduling \\nOne of the most difficult and dread-inducing components of project management for many is the need to \\noversee a large and diverse group of team members. While this text does not cover tips for getting along \\nwith others, ensuring that each project member is on task and up to date is an excellent way to reduce \\npotential problems associated with a complex project. To achieve this, there are several tools available to \\ntrack project schedules and goal completions. \\nThe Gantt chart (named after its creator, Henry Gantt) is a bar chart that is used specifically for tracking \\ntasks throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, Gantt charts show the dependencies of interrelated \\ntasks and focus on the start and completion dates for each specific task. Gantt charts will typically \\nrepresent the estimated task completion time in one color and the actual time to completion in a second Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  248 \\ncolor (Figure 10.2 \"Gantt Chart\"). This color coding allows project members to rapidly assess the project \\nprogress and identify areas of concern in a timely fashion. \\nFigure 10.2 Gantt Chart \\n \\nPERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts are similar to Gantt charts in that they are both \\nused to coordinate task completion for a given project (Figure 10.3 \"PERT Chart\"). PERT charts focus \\nmore on the events of a project than on the start and completion dates as seen with the Gantt charts. This \\nmethodology is more often used with very large projects where adherence to strict time guidelines is more \\nimportant than monetary considerations. PERT charts include the identification of the project\u2019s critical \\npath. After estimating the best- and worst-case scenario regarding the time to finish all tasks, the critical \\npath outlines the sequence of events that results in the longest potential duration for the project. Delays to \\nany of the critical path tasks will result in a net delay to project completion and therefore  must be closely \\nmonitored by the project manager. \\nFigure 10.3 PERT Chart \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  249 \\n \\nThere are some advantages and disadvantages to both the Gantt and PERT chart types. Gantt charts are \\npreferred when working with small, linear projects (with less than thirty or so  tasks, each of which occurs \\nsequentially). Larger projects (1) will not fit onto a single Gantt display, making them more difficult to \\nvisualize, and (2) quickly become too complex for the information therein to be related effectively. Gantt \\ncharts can also be problematic because they require a strong sense of the entire project\u2019s timing before the \\nfirst task has even been committed to the page. Also, Gantt charts don\u2019t take correlations between \\nseparate tasks into account. Finally, any change to the scheduling of the tasks in a Gantt chart results in \\nhaving to recreate the entire schedule, which can be a time-consuming and mind-numbing experience. \\nPERT charts also suffer from some drawbacks. For example, the time to completion for each individual \\ntask is not as clear as it is with the Gantt chart. Also, large project can become very complex and span \\nmultiple pages. Because neither method is perfect, project managers will often use Gantt and PERT charts \\nsimultaneously to incorporate the benefits of each methodology into their project. \\nWorking with CAD Data \\nWhile a GIS commands a large swath of the computer-generated mapping market share, it is not the only \\ncartographic player in town. GIS, as you now hopefully understand, is primarily a database -driven \\nmapping solution. Computer-aided design (CAD), on the other hand, is a graphics-based mapping \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  250 \\nsolution adopted by many cartographers; engineers in particular. Historically speaking, points, lines, and \\npolygons in a CAD system do not link to attributes but are mere drawings representing some reality. CAD \\nsoftware, however, has recently begun to incorporate \u201csmart\u201d features whereby attribute information is \\nexplicitly linked to the spatial representations. \\nCAD is typically used on many projects related to surveying and civil engineering work. For example, \\ncreating a cadastral map for a housing development is a complex matter with a fine scale of exactitude \\nrequired to ensure, for example, that all electrical, sewer, transportation, and gas lines meet at precise \\nlocales (Figure 10.4 \"CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project\"). An error of inches, in \\neither the vertical or horizontal dimension, could result in a need for a major plan redesign that may cost \\nthe client an inordinate amount of time and money. Too many of these types of errors, and you and your \\nengineer may soon be looking for a new job. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  251 \\nFigure 10.4 CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project \\n \\nRegardless, the CAD drawing used to create these development plans is usually only concerned with the \\nlocal information in and around the project site that directly affects the construction of the housing units, \\nsuch as local elevation, soil/substrates, land-use/land-cover types, surface water flows, and groundwater \\nresources. Therefore, local coordinate systems are typically employed by the civil engineer whereby the \\norigin coordinate (the 0, 0 point) is based off of some nearby landmark such as a manhole, fire hydrant, \\nstake, or some other survey control point. While this is acceptable for engineers, the GIS user typically is \\nconcerned not only with local phenomena but also with tying the project into a larger world.  \\nFor example, if a development project impacts a natural watercourse in the state of California, agencies \\nsuch as the US Army Corps of Engineers (a nationwide government agency), California Department of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  252 \\nFish and Game (a statewide government agency), and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (a local \\ngovernment agency) will each exert some regulatory requirements over the d eveloper. These agencies will \\nwant to know where the watercourse originates, where it flows to, where within the length of the \\nwatercourse the development project occurs, and what percentage of the watercourse will be impacted. \\nThese concerns can only be addressed by looking at the project in the larger context of the surrounding \\nwatershed(s) within which the project occurs. To accomplish this, external, standardized GIS datasets \\nmust be brought to bear on the project (e.g., national river reaches, stream f low and rain gauges, habitat \\nmaps, national soil surveys, and regional land-use/land-cover maps). These datasets will normally be \\ngeoreferenced to some global standard and therefore will not automatically overlay with the engineer\u2019s \\nlocal CAD data. \\nAs project manager, it will be your team\u2019s duty to import the CAD data (typically DWG, DGN, or DXF file \\nformat) and align it exactly with the other, georeferenced GIS data layers. While this has not been an easy \\ntask historically, sophisticated tools are being developed by both CAD and GIS software packages to \\nensure that they \u201cplay nicely\u201d with each other. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package contains a \\n\u201cGeoreferencing\u201d toolbar that allows users to shift, pan, resize, rotate, and add control points to assist in \\nthe realignment of CAD data. \\nApplication Development \\nAs project manager, you may discover that the GIS software package employed by your workgroup is \\nmissing some basic functionality that would greatly enhance the productivity of your team. In these cases, \\nit may be worthwhile to create your own GIS application(s). GIS applications are either stand -alone GIS \\nsoftware packages or customizations of a preexisting GIS software package that are made to meet some \\nspecific project need. These applications can range from simple (e.g., apply a standard symbol/color set \\nand text guidelines to mapped features) to complex (e.g., sort layers, select features based on a predefined \\nset of rules, perform a spatial analysis, and output a hard-copy map). \\nSome of the more simple applications can be created by using the canned tool sets and functionality \\nprovided in the GIS software. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package includes a macro language \\ncalled Model Builder that allows users with no knowledge of programming  languages create a series of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  253 \\nautomated tasks, also called workflows, which can be chained together and executed multiple times to \\nreduce the redundancy associated with many types of GIS analyses. The more complex applications will \\nmost likely require the use of the GIS software\u2019s native macro language or to write original code using \\nsome compatible programming language. To return to the example of ESRI products, ArcGIS provides the \\nability to develop and incorporate user-written programs, called scripts, into to standard platform. These \\nscripts can be written in the Python, VBScript, JScript, and Perl programming languages.  \\nWhile you may want to create a GIS application from the ground up to meet your project needs, there are \\nmany that have already been developed. These pre-written applications, many of which are open source, \\nmay be employed by your project team to reduce the time, money, and headache associated with such an \\neffort.

A sampling of these libraries is as follows: \\n1. GDAL/OGR (http://www.gdal.org)\u2014 \u201cGeospatial Data Abstraction Library/OpenGIS Simple \\nFeatures Reference Implementation\u201d is a compilation of translators for raster and vector \\ngeospatial data formats \\n2. Proj4 (http://proj.maptools.org)\u2014 A compilation of projection tools capable of transforming \\ndifferent cartographic projection systems, spheroids, and data points.  \\n3. GEOS (http://geos.refractions.net)\u2014 \u201cGeometry Engine, Open Source\u201d is a compilation of \\nfunctions for processing 2-D linear geometry \\n4. Mapnik (http://www.mapnik.org)\u2014 A tool kit for developing visually appealing maps from \\npreexisting file types (e.g., shapefiles, TIFF, OGR/GDAL) \\n5. FDO (http://fdo.osgeo.org)\u2014 \u201cFeature Data Objects\u201d is similar to, although more complex than, \\nGDAL/OGR in that it provides tools for manipulating, defining, translating, and analyzing \\ngeospatial datasets \\nWhile the C-based applications and libraries noted earlier are common due to their extensive time in \\ndevelopment, newer language families are supported as well. For example, Java has been used to develop \\nunique applications (e.g., gvSIG, OpenMap, uDig, Geoserver, JUMP, and DeeGree) from its l ibraries \\n(GeoAPI, WKB4J, GeoTools, and JTS Topology Suite), while .Net applications (e.g., MapWindow, \\nWorldWind, SharpMap) are a new but powerful application option that support their own libraries \\n(Proj.Net, NTS) as well as the C-based libraries. \\nMap Series \\nA project manager will often be required to produce paper and/or digital maps of the project site. These \\nmaps will typically include standard information such as a title, north arrow, scale bar, corporate contact \\ninformation, data source, and so forth. This is simple if the site is small enough that the pertinent mapped \\nfeatures can be resolved on a single map. However, problems arise if the site is exceedingly large, follows a \\nlinear pathway (e.g., highway improvement projects), or is composed of distant, noncontiguous site Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  255 \\nlocales. In these cases, the manager will need to create a series of easily referenced and reproduced maps \\nthat are at the exact same scale, have minimal overlap, and maintain consistent collar material \\nthroughout. \\nTo accomplish this task, a map series can be employed to create standar dized maps from the GIS (e.g., \\n\u201cDS Map Book\u201d for ArcGIS 9; \u201cData Driven Pages\u201d for ArcGIS 10). A map series is essentially a multipage \\ndocument created by dividing the overall data frame into unique tiles based on a user -\\ndefinedindex grid. Figure 10.5 \"Project Site Tiled into an Output Series\" shows an example of a map series \\nthat divides a project site into a grid of similar tiles. Figure 10.6 \"Output from a Map Series\"  shows the \\nstandardized maps produced when that series is printed. While these maps can certainly be created \\nwithout the use of a map series generator, this functionality greatly assists in the organization and display \\nof project\u2019s whose extents cannot be represented within a single map. \\nFigure 10.5 Project Site Tiled into an Output Series \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  256 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nFigure 10.6 Output from a Map Series \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nGrid-to-Ground Transformations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  257 \\nProject managers must be mindful of the transition from in-program mapped units to real-world \\nlocations. As discussed in Chapter 3 \"Data, Information, and Where to Find Them\", Section 3.2 \"Data \\nabout Data\", transforming the three-dimensional earth to two dimensions necessarily results in both \\naccuracy and precision errors. While projects that cover a small areal extent may not noticeably suffer \\nfrom this error, projects that cover a large areal extent could run into substantial problems. \\nWhen surveyors measure the angles and distances of features on the earth for input into a GIS, they are \\ntaking \u201cground\u201d measurements. However, spatial datasets in a GIS are based on a predefined coordinate \\nsystem, referred to as \u201cgrid\u201d measurements. In the case of angles, ground measurements are taken relative \\nto some north standard such as true north, grid north, or magnetic north. Grid measurements are always \\nrelative to the coordinate system\u2019s grid north. Therefore, grid north and ground north may well need to be \\nrotated in order to align correctly. \\nIn the case of distances, two sources of error may be present: (1) scale error and (2) elevation error. Scale \\nerror refers to the phenomenon whereby points measured on the three-dimensional earth (i.e., ground \\nmeasurement) must first be translated onto the coordinate system\u2019s ellipsoid (i.e., mean sea level), and \\nthen must be translated to the two-dimensional grid plane (Figure 10.7 \"Grid-to-Ground \\nTransformation\"). Basically, scale error is associated with the move from three to two dimensions and is \\nremedied by applying a scale factor (SF) to any measurements made to the dataset.  \\nFigure 10.7 Grid-to-Ground Transformation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  258 \\nIn addition to scale error, elevation error becomes increasingly pronounced as the project site\u2019s elevation \\nbegins to rise. Consider Figure 10.8 \"Grid versus Ground Measurements\", where a line measured as 1,000 \\nfeet at altitude must first be scaled down to fit the earth\u2019s ellipsoid measurement, then scaled again to fit \\nthe coordinate system\u2019s grid plane. Each such transition requires compensation, referred to as the \\nelevation factor (EF). The SF and EF are often combined into a single combination factor (CF) that is \\nautomatically applied to any measurements taken from the GIS. \\nFigure 10.8 Grid versus Ground Measurements \\n \\nIn addition to EF and SF errors, care must be taken when surveying areas greater than 5 miles in length. \\nAt these distances, slight errors will begin to compound and may create noticeable discrepancies. In \\nparticular, projects whose length crosses over coordinate systems zones (e.g., Universal Transverse \\nMercator [UTM] zones or State Plane zones) are likely to suffer from unacceptable grid -to-ground errors. \\nWhile the tools and techniques outlined in this section may be considered beyond the scope of an \\nintroductory text on GISs, these pages represent some of the concerns that will arise during your tenure as \\na GIS project manager. Although you will not need a comprehensive underst anding of these issues for \\nyour first GIS-related jobs, it is important that you understand that becoming a competent GIS user will \\nrequire a wide-ranging skill set, both technically and interpersonally. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  259 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 As project manager, you will need to utilize a wide variety of tools and techniques to complete your GIS \\nproject. \\n\u2022 The tools and techniques you employ will not necessarily be included as a part of your native GIS software \\npackage. In these cases, you will need to apply all project management r esources at your disposal. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. Consider the following GIS project: You are contacted by the City of Miami to determine the effect of \\ninundation due to sea-level rise on municipal properties over the next hundred years. Assuming that the \\nsea level will rise one meter during that time span, describe in detail the process you would take to \\nrespond to this inquiry. Assuming you have two months to complete this task, develop a timeline that \\nshows the steps you would take to respond to the city\u2019s request. In your discussion, include information \\npertaining to the data layers (both raster and vector), data sources, and data attributes needed to address \\nthe problem. Outline some of the geoprocessing steps that would be required to convert your baseline \\nGIS data into project-specific layers that would address this particular problem. Upon completion of the \\ngeospatial analysis, how might you employ cartographic principals to most effectively present the data to \\ncity officials?

Moreover, maps \\nof the twenty-first century are not just paper diagrams folded like an accordion. Maps today are \\ncolorful, searchable, interactive, and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and \\ninteractive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of \\ngeographic data. The key technology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the \\ntwenty-first century, is geographic information systems or GIS. \\nPut simply, GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from \\nvarious sources as maps. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of \u201cwhere\u201d has \\ntaken on new meaning. From getting directions to a new restaurant in San Francisco on your mobile \\ndevice to exploring what will happen to coastal cities like Venice if oceans were to rise due to global \\nwarming, GIS provides insights into daily tasks and the big challenges of the future. \\nEssentials of Geographic Information Systems integrates key concepts behind the technology with \\npractical concerns and real-world applications. Recognizing that many potential GIS users are \\nnonspecialists or may only need a few maps, this book is designed to be accessible, pragmatic, and \\nconcise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask \\nquestions, inform choices, and guide policy. From the melting of the polar ice caps to privacy issues \\nassociated with mapping, this book provides a gentle, yet substantive, introduction to the use and \\napplication of digital maps, mapping, and GIS. \\nIn today\\'s world, learning involves knowing how and where to search for information. In some \\nrespects, knowing where to look for answers and information is arguably just as important as the \\nknowledge itself. Because Essentials of Geographic Information Systems is concise, focused, and \\ndirected, readers are encouraged to search for supplementary information and to follow up on \\nspecific topics of interest on their own when necessary. Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems provides the foundations for learning GIS, but readers are encouraged to construct their \\nown individual frameworks of GIS knowledge. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. First, it Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  3 \\npromotes active learning through research. Second, it facilitates flexible and selective learning\u2014 that \\nis, what is learned is a function of individual needs and interest. \\nSince GIS and related geospatial and navigation technology change so rapidly, a flexible and dynamic \\ntext is necessary in order to stay current and relevant. Though essential concepts in GIS tend to \\nremain constant, the situations, applications, and examples of GIS are fluid and dynamic. Though \\nthis book is intended for use in introductory GIS courses, Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems will also appeal to the large number of certificate, professional, extension, and online \\nprograms in GIS that are available today. In addition to providing readers with the tools necessary to \\ncarry out spatial analyses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems outlines valuable \\ncartographic guidelines for maximizing the visual impact of your maps. The book also describes \\neffective GIS project management solutions that commonly arise in the modern workplace.

Knowing something about where something happens can \\nhelp us to understand what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and why it happened. \\nWhether it is an outbreak of a highly contagious disease, the discovery of a new frog species, the path of a \\ndeadly tornado, or the nearest location of a supermarket, knowing something about where things happen \\nis important to how we understand and relate to our local environment and to the world at large.  \\nA geographic information system\u2014 or GIS\u2014 is a special type of information technology that can help us \\nunderstand and relate to the \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the world by answering \u201cwhere.\u201d \\nGeographic information systems are indeed about maps, but they are also about much, much more.  \\nA GIS is used to organize, analyze, visualize, and share all kinds of data and information from different \\nhistorical periods and at various scales of analysis. From climatologists trying to understand the causes \\nand consequences of global warming, to epidemiologists locating ground zero of a virulent disease \\noutbreak, to archaeologists reconstructing ancient Rome, to political consultants developing campaign \\nstrategies for the next presidential election, GIS is a very powerful tool.  \\nMore important, GIS is about geography and learning about the world in which we live. As GIS techno logy \\ndevelops, as society becomes ever more geospatially enabled, and as more and more people rediscover \\ngeography and the power of maps, the future uses and applications of GIS are unlimited.  \\nTo take full advantage of the benefits of GIS and related geospatial technology both now and in the future, \\nit is useful to take stock of the ways in which we already think spatially with respect to the world in which \\nwe live. In other words, by recognizing and increasing our geographical awareness about how we relate  to \\nour local environment and the world at large, we will benefit more from our use and application of GIS.  \\nThe purpose of this chapter is to increase our geographical awareness and to refine our spatial thinking. \\nFirst, a simple mental mapping exercise is used to highlight our geographical knowledge and spatial \\nawareness, or lack thereof. Second, fundamental concepts and terms that are central to geographic \\ninformation systems, and more generally geography, are identified, defined, and explained. This chap ter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  5 \\nconcludes with a description of the frameworks that guide the use and application of GIS, as well as its \\nfuture development. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  6 \\n1.1 Spatial Thinking \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to illustrate how we think geographically every day with mental maps and \\nto highlight the importance of asking geographic questions. \\nAt no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to create or to acquire a map of nearly \\nanything. Maps and mapping technology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the modes \\nand means of making and distributing maps have been revolutionized with recent advances in \\ncomputing like the Internet, the art and science of map making date back centuries. This is because \\nhumans are inherently spatial organisms, and in order for us to live in the world, we must first \\nsomehow relate to it. Enter the mental map. \\nMental Maps \\nMental or cognitive maps are psychological tools that we all use every day. As the name \\nsuggests, mental maps are maps of our environment that are stored in our brain. We rely on our mental \\nmaps to get from one place to another, to plan our daily activities, or to understand and situate events that \\nwe hear about from our friends, family, or the news. Mental maps also reflect the amount and ex tent of \\ngeographic knowledge and spatial awareness that we possess. To illustrate this point, pretend that a friend \\nis visiting you from out of town for the first time. Using a blank sheet of paper, take five to ten minutes to \\ndraw a map from memory of your hometown that will help your friend get around. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  7 \\n \\nWhat did you choose to draw on your map? Is your house or where you work on the map? What about \\nstreets, restaurants, malls, museums, or other points of interest? How did you draw objects on your map? \\nDid you use symbols, lines, and shapes? Are places labeled? Why did you choose to include certain places \\nand features on your map but not others? What limitations did you encounter when making your map?  \\nThis simple exercise is instructive for several reasons. First, it illustrates what you know about where you \\nlive. Your simple map is a rough approximation of your local geographic knowledge and mental map. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  8 \\nSecond, it highlights the way in which you relate to your local environment. What you choose to include \\nand exclude on your map provides insights about what places you think are important and how you move \\nthrough your place or residence. Third, if we were to compare your mental map to someone else\u2019s from \\nthe same place, certain similarities emerge that shed light upon how we as humans tend to think spatially \\nand organize geographical information in our minds. Fourth, this exercise reveals something about your \\nartistic, creative, and cartographic abilities. In this respect, not only are mental maps unique, but also the \\nway in which such maps are drawn or represented on the page is unique too.  \\nTo reinforce these points, consider the series of mental maps of Los Angeles provided in Figure 1.1 \\n\"Mental Map of Los Angeles A\". \\nFigure 1.1 Mental Map of Los Angeles A \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  9 \\nFigure 1.2 Mental Map of Los Angeles B \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  10 \\nFigure 1.3 Mental Map of Los Angeles C \\n \\nTake a moment to look at each map and compare the maps with the following questions in mind:  \\n\u2022 What similarities are there on each map? \\n\u2022 What are some of the differences? \\n\u2022 Which places or features are illustrated on the map? \\n\u2022 From what you know about Los Angeles, what is included or excluded on the maps? \\n\u2022 What assumptions are made in each map? \\n\u2022 At what scale is the map drawn? \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  11 \\nEach map is probably an imperfect representation of one\u2019s mental map, but we can see some similarities \\nand differences that provide insights into how people relate to Los Angeles, maps, and more generally, the \\nworld. First, all maps are oriented so that north is up. Though only one of the maps contains a north \\narrow that explicitly informs viewers the geographic orientation of the map, we are accustomed to most \\nmaps having north at the top of the page. Second, all but the first map identify some prominent features \\nand landmarks in the Los Angeles area. For instance, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) appears on \\ntwo of these maps, as do the Santa Monica Mountains. How the airport is represented or portrayed on the \\nmap, for instance, as text, an abbreviation, or symbol, also speaks to our experience using and \\nunderstanding maps. Third, two of the maps depict a portion of the freeway network in Los Angeles, and \\none also highlights the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek. In a city where the \u201ccar is king,\u201d how can any \\nmap omit the freeways? \\nWhat you include and omit on your map, by choice or not, speaks volumes about your geographical \\nknowledge and spatial awareness\u2014 or lack thereof. Recognizing and identifying what we do not know is an \\nimportant part of learning. It is only when we identify the unknown that we  are able to ask questions, \\ncollect information to answer those questions, develop knowledge through answers, and begin to \\nunderstand the world where we live. \\nAsking Geographic Questions \\nFilling in the gaps in our mental maps and, more generally, the gaps in our geographic knowledge requires \\nus to ask questions about the world where we live and how we relate to it. Such questions can be simple \\nwith a local focus (e.g., \u201cWhich way is the nearest hospital?\u201d) or more complex with a more global \\nperspective (e.g., \u201cHow is urbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world?\u201d). The thread \\nthat unifies such questions is geography. For instance, the question of \u201cwhere?\u201d is an essential part of the \\nquestions \u201cWhere is the nearest hospital?\u201d and \u201cWhere are the biodiversity hotspots in relation to cities?\u201d \\nBeing able to articulate questions clearly and to break them into manageable pieces are very valuable \\nskills when using and applying a geographic information system (GIS).  \\nThough there may be no such thing as a \u201cdumb\u201d question, some questions are indeed better than others. \\nLearning how to ask the right question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding the answer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  12 \\nitself. However, when we ask the right question, problems are more easily solved and our understanding \\nof the world is improved. There are five general types of geographic questions that we can ask and that \\nGIS can help us to answer. Each type of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples \\n(Nyerges 1991). [1] \\nQuestions about geographic location: \\n\u2022 Where is it? \\n\u2022 Why is it here or there? \\n\u2022 How much of it is here or there? \\nQuestions about geographic distribution: \\n\u2022 Is it distributed locally or globally? \\n\u2022 Is it spatially clustered or dispersed? \\n\u2022 Where are the boundaries? \\nQuestions about geographic association: \\n\u2022 What else is near it? \\n\u2022 What else occurs with it? \\n\u2022 What is absent in its presence? \\nQuestions about geographic interaction: \\n\u2022 Is it linked to something else? \\n\u2022 What is the nature of this association? \\n\u2022 How much interaction occurs between the locations? \\nQuestions about geographic change: \\n\u2022 Has it always been here? \\n\u2022 How has it changed over time and space? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  13 \\n\u2022 What causes its diffusion or contraction? \\nThese and related geographic questions are frequently asked by people from various areas of  expertise, \\nindustries, and professions. For instance, urban planners, traffic engineers, and demographers may be \\ninterested in understanding the commuting patterns between cities and suburbs (geographic interaction). \\nBiologists and botanists may be curious about why one animal or plant species flourishes in one place and \\nnot another (geographic location/distribution). Epidemiologists and public health officials are certainly \\ninterested in where disease outbreaks occur and how, why, and where they spread (g eographic \\nchange/interaction/location). \\nA GIS can assist in answering all these questions and many more. Furthermore, a GIS often opens up \\nadditional avenues of inquiry when searching for answers to geographic questions. Herein is one of the \\ngreatest strengths of the GIS. While a GIS can be used to answer specific questions or to solve particular \\nproblems, it often unearths even more interesting questions and presents more problems to be solved in \\nthe future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Mental maps are psychological tools that we use to understand, relate to, and navigate through the \\nenvironment in which we live, work, and play. \\n\u2022 Mental maps are unique to the individual. \\n\u2022 Learning how to ask geographic questions is important to using and applying GISs.  \\n\u2022 Geographic questions are concerned with location, distributions, associations, interactions, and change.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Draw a map of where you live. Discuss the similarities, differences, styles, and techniques on your map \\nand compare them with two others. What are the commonalities between the maps? What are the \\ndifferences? What accounts for such similarities and differences?  \\n2. Draw a map of the world and compare it to a world map in an atlas. What similarities and differences are \\nthere? What explains the discrepancies between your map and the atlas? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  14 \\n3. Provide two questions concerned with geographic location, distribution, association, interaction, and \\nchange about global warming, urbanization, biodiversity, economic development, and war.  \\n \\n[1] Nyerges, T. 1991. \u201cAnalytical Map Use.\u201d Cartography and Geographic Information Systems (formerly The \\nAmerican Cartographer) 18: 11\u201322. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  15 \\n1.2 Geographic Concepts \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to introduce and explain how the key concepts of location, direction, \\ndistance, space, and navigation are relevant to geography and geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nBefore we can learn \u201chow to do\u201d a geographic information system (GIS), it is first necessary to review \\nand reconsider a few key geographic concepts that are often taken for granted. For instance, what is a \\nlocation and how can it be defined? At what distance does a location become \u201cnearby\u201d? Or what do \\nwe mean when we say that someone has a \u201cgood sense of direction\u201d? By answering these and related \\nquestions, we establish a framework that will help us to learn and to apply a GIS. This framework \\nwill also permit us to share and communicate geographic information with others, which can \\nfacilitate collaboration, problem solving, and decision making. \\nLocation \\nThe one concept that distinguishes geography from other fields is location, which is central to a \\nGIS. Location is simply a position on the surface of the earth. What is more, nearly everything can be \\nassigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of something, we can a put it on a map, for \\nexample, with a GIS. \\nGenerally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or absolute terms. In the case of the \\nformer, locations are simply defined and described by name. For example, city names such as New York, \\nTokyo, or London refer to nominal locations. Toponymy, or the study of place names and their respective \\nhistory and meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations (Monmonier 1996, 2006).  [1], [2] Though \\nwe tend to associate the notion of location with particular points on the surface of the earth, locations can \\nalso refer to geographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g., Siberia). The United States \\nBoard on Geographic Names (http://geonames.usgs.gov) maintains geographic naming standards and \\nkeeps track of such names through the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS; \\nhttp://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic). The GNIS database also provides information about which \\nstate and county the feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  16 \\nContrasting nominal locations are absolute locations that use some type of reference system to define \\npositions on the earth\u2019s surface. For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth using latitude \\nand longitude is an example of absolute location. Postal codes and street addresses are other examples of \\nabsolute location that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there is no global standard when it \\ncomes to street addresses, we can determine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of \\nparticular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and other geographic data through a pr ocess \\ncalled geocoding. There are several free online geocoders (e.g., http://worldkit.org/geocoder) that return \\nthe latitude and longitude for various locations and addresses around the world.  \\nWith the advent of the global positioning system (GPS) (see alsohttp://www.gps.gov), determining the \\nlocation of nearly any object on the surface of the earth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. \\nGPS technology consists of a constellation of twenty-four satellites that are orbiting the earth and \\nconstantly transmitting time signals (see Figure 1.4 \"Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) \\nSatellites\"). To determine a position, earth-based GPS units (e.g., handheld devices, car navigation \\nsystems, mobile phones) receive the signals from at least three of these satellites and use this information \\nto triangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate system (GCS) to report location. \\nOriginally developed by the United States Department of Defense for military purposes, there are now a \\nwide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  17 \\nFigure 1.4 Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites \\n \\nLocation can also be defined in relative terms. Relative location refers to defining and describing places in \\nrelation to other known locations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg, South Africa; New \\nZealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul, Afghanistan, is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike \\nnominal or absolute locations that define single points, relative locations provide a bit more information \\nand situate one place in relation to another. \\nDirection \\nLike location, the concept of direction is central to geography and GISs. Direction refers to the position of \\nsomething relative to something else usually along a line. In order to determine direction, a reference \\npoint or benchmark from which direction will be measured needs to be established. One of the most \\ncommon benchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric direction refers to when we use \\nourselves as a directional benchmark. Describing something as \u201cto my left,\u201d \u201cbehind me,\u201d or \u201cnext to me\u201d \\nare examples of egocentric direction. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  18 \\nAs the name suggests, landmark direction uses a known landmark or geographic feature as a benchmark \\nto determine direction. Such landmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point of interest \\nlike the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature like a mountain range or river. The important thing to \\nremember about landmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that the landmark should be \\nrelatively well-known. \\nIn geography and GISs, there are three more standard benchmarks that are used  to define the directions \\nof true north, magnetic north, and grid north. True north is based on the point at which the axis of the \\nearth\u2019s rotation intersects the earth\u2019s surface. In this respect the North and South Poles serve as the \\ngeographic benchmarks for determining direction. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the \\nsurface of the earth where the earth\u2019s magnetic fields converge. This is also the point to which magnetic \\ncompasses point. Note that magnetic north falls somewhere in northern Canada and is not geographically \\ncoincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid north simply refers to the northward direction that the \\ngrid lines of latitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point to.  \\nFigure 1.5 The Three Norths: True, Magnetic, and Grid \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  19 \\nSource: http://kenai.fws.gov/overview/notebook/2004/sept/3sep2004.htm \\nDistance \\nComplementing the concepts of location and direction is distance. Distance refers to the degree or amount \\nof separation between locations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with various units. We \\ncan describe the distances between locations nominally as \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall,\u201d or we can describe two or \\nmore locations as \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar apart.\u201d Absolute distance is measured or calculated using a standard \\nmetric. The formula for the distance between two points on a planar (i.e., flat) surface is the following: \\nD=(x2\u2212x1)2+(y2\u2212y1)2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a \\nCalculating the distance between two locations on the surface of the earth, ho wever, is a bit more involved \\nbecause we are dealing with a three-dimensional object. Moving from the three-dimensional earth to two-\\ndimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile devices is not a trivial matter and is discussed \\nin greater detail in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". \\nWe also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the distance between London and \\nSingapore can be measured in miles, kilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship. \\nWhether or not such distances make London and Singapore \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar\u201d from each other is a matter of \\nopinion, experience, and patience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that derived from \\nthe distance formula, provide a standardized method to measure how far away o r how near locations are \\nfrom each other. \\nSpace \\nWhere distance suggests a measurable quantity in terms of how far apart locations are situated, space is a \\nmore abstract concept that is more commonly described rather than measured. For example, space can be  \\ndescribed as \u201cempty,\u201d \u201cpublic,\u201d or \u201cprivate.\u201d \\nWithin the scope of a GIS, we are interested in space, and in particular, we are interested in what fills \\nparticular spaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this sense,  space is a somewhat \\nambiguous and generic term that is used to denote the general geographic area of interest.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  20 \\nOne kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is topological space. Simply put, topological \\nspace is concerned with the nature of relationships and the connectivity of locations within a given space. \\nWhat is important within topological space are (1) how locations are (or are not) related or connected to \\neach other and (2) the rules that govern such geographic relationships.  \\nTransportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the best illustrations of topological \\nspaces (see Figure 1.6 \"Metro Map from London\" and Figure 1.7 \"Metro Map from Moscow\"). When using \\nsuch maps, we are primarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another along  a transportation \\nnetwork. Certain rules also govern how we can travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible \\nonly at a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular line). Such maps may be of little \\nuse when traveling around a city by car or foot, but they show the local transportation network and how \\nlocations are linked together in an effective and efficient manner.  \\nFigure 1.6 Metro Map from London \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  21 \\nFigure 1.7 Metro Map from Moscow \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  22 \\nNavigation \\nTransportation maps like those discussed previously illustrate how we move through the environments \\nwhere we live, work, and play. This movement and, in particular, destination-oriented travel are generally \\nreferred to as navigation. How we navigate through space is a complex pro cess that blends together our \\nvarious motor skills; technology; mental maps; and awareness of locations, distances, directions, and the \\nspace where we live (Golledge and Stimson 1997). [3] What is more, our geographical knowledge and \\nspatial awareness is continuously updated and changed as we move from one location to another.  \\nThe acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor. Though several factors influence the \\nnature of such knowledge, we tend to rely on the three following types of geograph ic knowledge when \\nnavigating through space: \\n1. Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and identify unique points, patterns, or features \\n(e.g., landmarks) in space. \\n2. Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between landmarks by moving throug h space. \\n3. Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks are in relation to each other and to take \\nshortcuts. \\nEach type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after the other. For instance, when we find \\nourselves in a new or an unfamiliar location, we usually identify a few unique points of interest (e.g., \\nhotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are in essence building up our landmark knowledge. \\nUsing and traveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge and rei nforces our landmark \\nknowledge and our overall geographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin to \\nunderstand how routes connect landmarks together and how various locations are situated in space. It is \\nat this point, when we are somewhat comfortable with our survey knowledge, that we are able to take \\nshortcuts from one location to another. Though there is no guarantee that a shortcut will be successful, if \\nwe get lost, we are at least expanding our local geographic knowledge.  \\nLandmark, route, and survey knowledge are the cornerstones of having a sense of direction and frame our \\ngeographical learning and awareness. While some would argue that they are born with a good sense of \\ndirection, others admit to always getting lost. The popularity of personal navigation devices and online Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  23 \\nmapping services speaks to the overwhelming desire to know and to situate where we are in the world. \\nThough developing and maintaining a keen sense of direction presumably matters less and less as such \\ndevices and services continue to develop and spread, it can also be argued that the more we know about \\nwhere we are in the world, the more we will want to learn about it.  \\nThis section covers concepts essential to geography, GISs, and many other fields of interest. \\nUnderstanding how location, direction, and distance can be defined and described provides an important \\nfoundation for the successful use and implementation of a GIS. Thinking about space and how we \\nnavigate through it also serves to improve and own geographic knowledge and spatial awareness. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Location refers to the position of an object on the surface of the earth and is commonly expressed in \\nterms of latitude and longitude. \\n\u2022 Direction is always determined relative to a benchmark. \\n\u2022 Distance refers to the separation between locations. \\n\u2022 Navigation is the destination-oriented movement through space. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to define and describe how a geographic information system (GIS) is \\napplied, its development, and its future. \\nUp to this point, the primary concern of this chapter was to introduce concepts essential to \\ngeography that are also relevant to geographic information systems (GISs). Furthermore, the \\nintroduction of these concepts was prefaced by an overview of how we think spatially and the nature \\nof geographic inquiry. This final section is concerned with defining a GIS, describing its use, and \\nexploring its future. \\nGIS Defined \\nSo what exactly is a GIS? Is it computer software? Is it a collection of computer hardware? I s it a service \\nthat is distributed and accessed via the Internet? Is it a tool? Is it a system? Is it a science? The answer to \\nall these questions is, \u201cGIS is all of the above\u2014 and more.\u201d \\nFrom a software perspective, a GIS consists of a special type of computer program capable of storing, \\nediting, processing, and presenting geographic data and information as maps. There are several GIS \\nsoftware providers, such as Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. ( http://www.esri.com), which \\ndistributes ArcGIS, and PitneyBowes (http://www.pbinsight.com), which distributes MapInfo GIS. \\nThough online mapping services and interfaces are provided by companies like Google, Yahoo!, and \\nMicrosoft, such services are not (yet) considered fully fledged GIS platforms. There are also open -source \\nGIS options, such as GRASS (http://grass.itc.it), which is freely distributed and maintained by the open-\\nsource community. All GIS software, regardless of vendor, consists of a database management system that \\nis capable of handling and integrating two types of data: spatial data and attribute data.  \\nSpatial data refer to the real-world geographic objects of interest, such as streets, buildings, lakes, and \\ncountries, and their respective locations. In addition to location, each of these objects also possesses \\ncertain traits of interest, or attributes, such as a name, number of stories, depth, or population. GIS \\nsoftware keeps track of both the spatial and attribute data and permits us to link the two types of data \\ntogether to create information and facilitate analysis. One popular way to describe and to visualize a GIS Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  25 \\nis picturing it as a cake with many layers. Each layer of the cake represents a different geographic theme, \\nsuch as water features, buildings, and roads, and each layer is stacked one on top of another (see  Figure \\n1.8 \"A GIS as a Layered Cake\"). \\nFigure 1.8 A GIS as a Layered Cake \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  26 \\nAs hardware, a GIS consists of a computer, memory, storage devices, scanners, printers, global \\npositioning system (GPS) units, and other physical components. If the computer is situated on a network, \\nthe network can also be considered an integral component of the GIS because it enables us to share data \\nand information that the GIS uses as inputs and creates as outputs.  \\nAs a tool, a GIS permits us to maintain, analyze, and share a wealth of data and information. From the \\nrelatively simple task of mapping the path of a hurricane to the more c omplex task of determining the \\nmost efficient garbage collection routes in a city, a GIS is used across the public and private sectors. \\nOnline and mobile mapping, navigation, and location-based services are also personalizing and \\ndemocratizing GISs by bringing maps and mapping to the masses. \\nThese are just a few definitions of a GIS. Like several of the geographic concepts discussed previously, \\nthere is no single or universally accepted definition of a GIS. There are probably just as many definitions \\nof GISs as there are people who use GISs. In this regard, it is the people like you who are learning, \\napplying, developing, and studying GISs in new and compelling ways that unifies it.  \\nThree Approaches to GISs \\nIn addition to recognizing the many definitions of a GIS, it is also constructive to identify three general \\nand overlapping approaches to understanding GISs\u2014 the application approach, the developer approach, \\nand the science approach. Though most GIS users would probably identify with one approach more than \\nanother, they are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, as GISs and, more generally, information technology \\nadvance, the following categories will be transformed and reshaped accordingly.  \\nThe application approach to GISs considers a GIS primarily to be a tool.  This is also perhaps the most \\ncommon view of a GIS. From this perspective, a GIS is used to answer questions, support decision \\nmaking, maintain an inventory of geographic data and information, and, of course, make maps. As a tool, \\nthere are arguably certain skills that should be acquired and required in order to use and apply a GIS \\nproperly. The application approach to a GIS is more concerned with using and applying GISs to solve \\nproblems than the GIS itself. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  27 \\nFor instance, suppose we want to determine the best location for a new supermarket. What factors are \\nimportant behind making this decision? Information about neighborhood demographics, existing \\nsupermarkets, the location of suppliers, zoning regulations, and available real estate are all critical to th is \\ndecision. A GIS platform can integrate such information that is obtained from the census bureau, realtors, \\nthe local zoning agency, and even the Internet. A suitability analysis can then be carried out with the GIS, \\nthe output of which will show the best locations for the supermarket given the various local geographic \\nopportunities (e.g., demographics/consumers) and constraints (e.g., supply chain, zoning, and real estate \\nlimitations) that exist. \\nThere are several professional communities and organizations concerned with the use and application of a \\nGIS, such as the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association ( http://urisa.org) and the Global \\nSpatial Data Infrastructure Association (http://www.gsdi.org). \\nUnlike the previous example in which a GIS is applied to answer or solve a particular question, the \\ndeveloper approach to GISs is concerned with the development of the GIS as a software or technology \\nplatform. Rather than focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned \\nwith improving, refining, and extending the tool and technology itself and is largely in the realm of \\ncomputer programmers and software developers. \\nThe ongoing integration and evolution of GISs, maps, the Internet, and web-based mapping can be \\nconsidered an outcome of the developer approach to GISs. In this regard, delivering maps, navigation \\ntools, and user-friendly GISs to people via the Internet is the central challenge at hand. The underlying, \\nand to a large extent hidden, logic and computer code that permit us to ask questions about how to get \\nfrom point A to point B on a navigation website or to see where a new restaurant or open house is located \\non a web-based map are for the most part the domain of GIS programmers and developers. The Open \\nSource Geospatial Foundation (http://www.osgeo.org) is another example of a community of GIS \\ndevelopers working to build and distribute open-source GIS software. \\nIt is the developer approach to GISs that drives and introduces innovation and is informed and guided by \\nthe existing needs and future demands of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting \\nedge, it is dynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  28 \\nThe science approach to GISs not only dovetails with the applications and developer approaches but also \\nis more concerned with broader questions and how geography, cognition, m ap interpretation, and other \\ngeospatial issues such as accuracy and errors are relevant to GISs and vice versa (see Longley et al. \\n2005). [1] This particular approach is often referred to as geographic information science (GIScience), and \\nit is also interested in the social consequences and implications of the use and diffusion of GIS technology. \\nFrom exploring the propagation of error to examining how privacy is being redefined by GISs and related \\ntechnology, GIScience is at the same time an agent of change as well as one of understanding. \\nIn light of the rapid rate of technological and GIS innovation, in conjunction with the widespread \\napplication of GISs, new questions about GIS technology and its use are continually emerging. One of the \\nmost discussed topics concerns privacy, and in particular, what is referred to as locational privacy. In \\nother words, who has the right to view or determine your geographic location at any given time? Your \\nparents? Your school? Your employer? Your cell phone carrier? The government or police? When are you \\nwilling to divulge your location? Is there a time or place where you prefer to be \u201coff the grid\u201d or not \\nlocatable? Such questions concerning locational privacy were of relatively little concern a few years ago. \\nHowever, with the advent of GPS and its integration into cars and other mobile devices, questions, \\ndebates, and even lawsuits concerning locational privacy and who has the right to such information are \\nrapidly emerging. \\nAs the name suggests, the developer approach to GISs is concerned with the development of GISs. Rather \\nthan focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned with improving, \\nrefining, and extending the tool itself and is largely in the realm of computer programmers an d software \\ndevelopers. For instance, the advent of web-based mapping is an outcome of the developer approach to \\nGISs. In this regard, the challenge was how to bring GISs to people via the Internet and not necessarily \\nhow people would use web-based GISs. The developer approach to GISs drives and introduces innovation \\nand is guided by the needs of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting edge, it is \\ndynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  \\nGIS Futures Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  29 \\nThe definitions and approaches to GISs described previously illustrate the scope and breadth of this \\nspecial type of information technology. Furthermore, as GISs become more accessible and widely \\ndistributed, there will always be new questions to be answered, new applications to be developed, and \\ninnovative technologies to integrate. \\nOne notable development is the emergence of what is called the geospatial web. The geospatial web or \\ngeoweb refers to the integration of the vast amounts of content available on t he Internet (e.g., text, \\nphotographs, video, and music) with geographic information, such as location. Adding such geographic \\ninformation to such content is called geotagging and is similar to geocoding. The integration of geographic \\ninformation with such content opens up new ways to access, search, organize, share, and distribute \\ninformation. \\nMapping mashups, or web-based applications that combine data and information from one source and \\nmap it with online mapping applications, are an example of the geoweb  at work. There are mashups for \\nnearly everything that can be assigned a location, from restaurants and music festivals to your \\nphotographs and favorite hikes. Several examples of such mapping mashups can be found on the Internet \\nat sites such as http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com. \\nThough the geoweb may not necessarily be considered a GIS, it certainly draws upon the same concepts \\nand ideas of geography and may someday encompass GISs. Perhaps more important, the diffusion of GISs \\nand the emergence of the geoweb have increased geographic awareness by lowering the barriers of \\nviewing, using, and even creating maps and related geographic data and information. Though there are \\nseveral benefits to this democratization of GISs, and more generally information and technology, it should \\nalso be recognized that there are also consequences and implications.  \\nAs with any other technology, great care must be taken in the use and application of GISs. For instance, \\nwhen was the last time you questioned what appeared on a map? For better or worse, maps are among the \\nmost authoritative forms of information and are the subject of Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". As tomorrow\u2019s \\nGIS practitioners, you will have the ability to influence greatly how decisions are made and how others \\nview and relate to the world with the maps that you create in a GIS environment. What and how you Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  30 \\nchoose to map is therefore a nontrivial exercise. Becoming more aware of our biases, limitations, and \\npreferences permits us to take full advantage of geographic information systems with confidence.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 There is no single or universal definition of a GIS; it is defined and used in many different ways.  \\n\u2022 One of the key features of a GIS is that it integrates spatial data with attribute data. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The chapter concludes with a discussion of the process of \\nmap abstraction as it relates to GISs. This chapter provides the foundations for working with, \\nintegrating, and making maps with GISs. \\n \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  32 \\n2.1 Maps and Map Types \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to define what a map is and to describe reference, thematic, and dynamic \\nmaps. \\nMaps are among the most compelling forms of information for several reasons. Maps are artistic. Maps \\nare scientific. Maps preserve history. Maps clarify. Maps reveal the invisible. Maps inform the future. \\nRegardless of the reason, maps capture the imagination of people around the world. As one of the most \\ntrusted forms of information, map makers and geographic information system (GIS) practitioners hold a \\nconsiderable amount of power and influence (Wood 1992; Monmonier 1996).  [1], [2] Therefore, \\nunderstanding and appreciating maps and how maps convey information are important aspects of GISs. \\nThe appreciation of maps begins with exploring various map types.  \\nSo what exactly is a map? Like GISs, there are probably just as many definitions of maps as there are \\npeople who use and make them (see Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998). [3] For starters, we can define a map \\nsimply as a representation of the world. Such maps can be stored in our brain (i.e., mental maps), they can \\nbe printed on paper, or they can appear online. Notwithstanding the actual medium of the map (e.g., our \\nfleeting thoughts, paper, or digital display), maps represent and describe various aspects of the world. For \\npurposes of clarity, the three types of maps are the reference map, the thematic map, and the dynamic \\nmap. \\nReference Maps \\nThe primary purpose of a reference map is to deliver location information to the map user. Geographic \\nfeatures and map elements on a reference map tend to be treated and represented equally. In other words, \\nno single aspect of a reference map takes precedent over any other aspect. Moreover, reference maps \\ngenerally represent geographic reality accurately. Examples of some common types of reference maps \\ninclude topographic maps such as those created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS; \\nseehttp://topomaps.usgs.gov) and image maps obtained from satellites or aircraft that are available \\nthrough online mapping services. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  33 \\nFigure 2.1 USGS Topographic Map of Boulder, CO \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  34 \\nFigure 2.2 Image Map of Palm Island, Dubai, from NASA \\n \\nThe accuracy of a given reference map is indeed critical to many users. For instance, local governments \\nneed accurate reference maps for land use, zoning, and tax purposes. National governments need accurate \\nreference maps for political, infrastructure, and military purposes. People who depend on navigation \\ndevices like global positioning system (GPS) units also need accurate and up -to-date reference maps in \\norder to arrive at their desired destinations. \\nThematic Maps \\nContrasting the reference map are thematic maps. As the name suggests, thematic  maps are concerned \\nwith a particular theme or topic of interest. While reference maps emphasize the location of geographic \\nfeatures, thematic maps are more concerned with how things are distributed across space . Such things are \\noften abstract concepts such as life expectancy around the world, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \\nin Europe, or literacy rates across India. One of the strengths of mapping, and in particular of thematic \\nmapping, is that it can make such abstract and invisible concepts visible and comparable on a map.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  35 \\nFigure 2.3 World Life Expectancies \\n \\nFigure 2.4 European GDP \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  36 \\nFigure 2.5 Indian Literacy Rates \\n \\nIt is important to note that reference and thematic maps are not mutually exclusive. In other words, \\nthematic maps often contain and combine geographical reference information, and conversely, reference \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  37 \\nmaps may contain thematic information. What is more, when used in conjunction, thematic and reference \\nmaps often complement each other. \\nFor example, public health officials in a city may be interested in providing equal access to emergency \\nrooms to the city\u2019s residents. Insights into this and related questions can be obtained through visual \\ncomparisons of a reference map that shows the locations of emergency rooms across the city to thematic \\nmaps of various segments of the population (e.g., households below poverty, percent elderly, \\nunderrepresented groups). \\nWithin the context of a GIS, we can overlay the reference map of emergency rooms directly on top of the \\npopulation maps to see whether or not access is uniform across neighborhood types. Clearly, there are \\nother factors to consider when looking at emergency room access (e.g., access to transport), but through \\nsuch map overlays, underserved neighborhoods can be identified. \\nFigure 2.6 Map Overlay Process \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  38 \\nWhen presented in hardcopy format, both reference and thematic maps are static or fixed representations \\nof reality. Such permanence on the page suggests that geography and the things that we map are also in \\nmany ways fixed or constant. This is far from reality. The integration of GISs with other forms of \\ninformation technology like the Internet and mobile telecommunications is rapidly changing this view of \\nmaps and mapping, as well as geography at large. \\nDynamic Maps \\nThe diffusion of GISs and the popularity of online mapping tools and applications speak to this shift in \\nthinking about maps and map use. In this regard, it is worthwhile to discuss the diffusion of dynamic \\nmaps. Dynamic maps are simply changeable or interactive representations of the earth. Dynamic mapping \\nrefers more to how maps are used and delivered to the map user today (e.g., online, via mobile phone) \\nthan to the content of the map itself. Both reference and thematic maps can be dynamic in nature, and \\nsuch maps are an integral component to any GIS. The key point about dynamic maps is that more and \\nmore people, not just GIS professionals, have access to such maps. \\nUnlike a hardcopy map that has features and elements users cannot modify or change, dynamic maps \\nencourage and sometimes require user interaction. Such interaction can include changing the scale or \\nvisible area by zooming in or zooming out, selecting which features or layers to include or to remove from \\na map (e.g., roads, imagery), or even starting and stopping a map animation.  \\nFigure 2.7 Google Maps on an iPhone \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  39 \\nFigure 2.8 Polar Ice Cap \\n \\nTo see the animation, go to http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?3464. \\nJust as dynamic maps will continue to evolve and require more user interaction in the future, map users \\nwill demand more interactive map features and controls. As this democratization of maps and mapping \\ncontinues, the geographic awareness and map appreciation of map users will also increase. Therefore, it is \\nof critical importance to understand the nature, form, and content of maps to support the changing needs , \\ndemands, and expectations of map users in the future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The main purpose of a reference map is to show the location of geographical objects of interest.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  40 \\n\u2022 Thematic maps are concerned with showing how one or more geographical aspects are distributed across \\nspace. \\n\u2022 Dynamic maps refer to maps that are changeable and often require user interaction.  \\n\u2022 The democratization of maps and mapping is increasing access, use, and appreciation for all types of \\nmaps, as well as driving map innovations. \\n \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to describe and discuss the concepts of map scale, coordinate systems, and \\nmap projections and explain why they are central to maps, mapping, and geographic information systems \\n(GISs). \\nAll map users and map viewers have certain expectations about what is contained on a map. Such \\nexpectations are formed and learned from previous experience by working with maps. It is important \\nto note that such expectations also change with increased exposure to maps. Understanding and \\nmeeting the expectations of map viewers is a challenging but necessary task because such \\nexpectations provide a starting point for the creation of any map. \\nThe central purpose of a map is to provide relevant and useful information to the map user. In order \\nfor a map to be of value, it must convey information effectively and efficiently. Mapping conventions \\nfacilitate the delivery of information in such a manner by recognizing and managing the expectations \\nof map users. Generally speaking, mapping or cartographic conventions refer to the accepted rules, \\nnorms, and practices behind the making of maps. One of the most recognized mapping conventions \\nis that \u201cnorth is up\u201d on most maps. Though this may not always be the case, many map users expect \\nnorth to be oriented or to coincide with the top edge of a map or viewing device like a computer \\nmonitor. \\nSeveral other formal and informal mapping conventions and characteristics, many of which are \\ntaken for granted, can be identified. Among the most important cartographic considerations are map \\nscale, coordinate systems, and map projections. Map scale is concerned with reducing geographical \\nfeatures of interest to manageable proportions, coordinate systems help us define the positions of \\nfeatures on the surface of the earth, and map projections are concerned with moving from the three-\\ndimensional world to the two dimensions of a flat map or display, all of which are discussed in \\ngreater detail in this chapter. \\nMap Scale Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  42 \\nThe world is a big place\u2026really big. One of the challenges behind mapping the world and its resident \\nfeatures, patterns, and processes is reducing it to a manageable size. What exactly is meant by \\n\u201cmanageable\u201d is open to discussion and largely depends on the purpose and needs of the map at hand. \\nNonetheless, all maps reduce or shrink the world and its geographic features of interest by some \\nfactor. Map scale refers to the factor of reduction of the world so it fits on a map.  \\nMap scale can be represented by text, a graphic, or some combination of the two. For example, it is \\ncommon to see \u201cone inch represents one kilometer\u201d or something similar written on a map to give map \\nusers an idea of the scale of the map. Map scale can also be portrayed graphically with what is called a \\nscale bar. Scale bars are usually used on reference maps and allow map users to approximate distances \\nbetween locations and features on a map, as well as to get an overall idea of the scale of the map.  \\nFigure 2.9 Map Scale from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Map \\n \\nThe representative fraction (RF) describes scale as a simple ratio. The numerator, which is always set to \\none (i.e., 1), denotes map distance and the denominator denotes ground or \u201creal-world\u201d distance. One of \\nthe benefits of using a representative fraction to describe scale is that it is unit neutral. In other words, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  43 \\nany unit of measure can be used to interpret the map scale. Consider a map with an RF of 1:10,000. This \\nmeans that one unit on the map represents 10,000 units on the ground. Such units could be inches, \\ncentimeters, or even pencil lengths; it really does not matter. \\nMap scales can also be described as either \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge.\u201d Such descriptions are usually made in \\nreference to representative fractions and the amount of detail represented on a map. For instance, a map \\nwith an RF of 1:1,000 is considered a large-scale map when compared to a map with an RF of 1:1,000,000 \\n(i.e., 1:1,000 > 1:1,000,000). Furthermore, while the large-scale map shows more detail and less area, the \\nsmall-scale map shows more area but less detail. Clearly, determining the thresholds for small - or large-\\nscale maps is largely a judgment call. \\nAll maps possess a scale, whether it is formally expressed or not. Though some say that online maps and \\nGISs are \u201cscaleless\u201d because we can zoom in and out at will, it is probably more accurate to say that GISs \\nand related mapping technology are multiscalar. Understanding map scale and its overall impact on h ow \\nthe earth and its features are represented is a critical part of both map making and GISs.  \\nCoordinate Systems \\nJust as all maps have a map scale, all maps have locations, too. Coordinate  systems are frameworks that \\nare used to define unique positions. For instance, in geometry we use x (horizontal) and y (vertical) \\ncoordinates to define points on a two-dimensional plane. The coordinate system that is most commonly \\nused to define locations on the three-dimensional earth is called the geographic coordinate system (GCS), \\nand it is based on a sphere or spheroid. A spheroid (a.k.a. ellipsoid  is simply a sphere that is slightly wider \\nthan it is tall and approximates more closely the true shape of the earth. Spheres are commonly used as \\nmodels of the earth for simplicity. \\nThe unit of measure in the GCS is degrees, and locations are defined by their respective latitude and \\nlongitude within the GCS. Latitude is measured relative to the equator at zero degrees, with maxima of \\neither ninety degrees north at the North Pole or ninety degrees south at the South Pole. Longitude is \\nmeasured relative to the prime meridian at zero degrees, with maxima of 180 degrees west or 180 degrees \\neast. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  44 \\nNote that latitude and longitude can be expressed in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) or in decimal \\ndegrees (DD). When using decimal degrees, latitudes above the equator and longitudes east of the prime \\nmeridian are positive, and latitudes below the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian are \\nnegative (see the following table for examples). \\n \\nNominal location Absolute location (DMS) Absolute location (DD) \\nLos Angeles, US 34\u00b0 3\u2032 North, 118\u00b0 15\u2032 West +34.05, \u2013118.25 \\nMumbai, India 18\u00b0 58\u2032 North, 72\u00b0 49\u2032 East +18.975, +72.8258 \\nSydney, Australia 33\u00b0 51\u2032 South, 151\u00b0 12\u2032 East \u201333.859, 151.211 \\nSao Paolo, Brazil 23\u00b0 33\u2032 South, 46\u00b0 38\u2032 West \u201323.550, \u201346.634 \\nConverting from DMS to DD is a relatively straightforward exercise. For example, since there are sixty \\nminutes in one degree, we can convert 118\u00b0 15 minutes to 118.25 (118 + 15/60). Note that an online search \\nof the term \u201ccoordinate conversion\u201d will return several coordinate conversion tools. \\nWhen we want to map things like mountains, rivers, streets, and buildings, we need to define how the \\nlines of latitude and longitude will be oriented and positioned on the sphere. A datum serves this purpose \\nand specifies exactly the orientation and origins of the lines of latitude and longitude relative to the center \\nof the earth or spheroid. \\nDepending on the need, situation, and location, there are several datums to choose from. For instance, \\nlocal datums try to match closely the spheroid to the earth\u2019s surface in a local area and return accurate \\nlocal coordinates. A common local datum used in the United States is  called NAD83 (i.e., North American \\nDatum of 1983). For locations in the United States and Canada, NAD83 returns relatively accurate \\npositions, but positional accuracy deteriorates when outside of North America.  \\nThe global WGS84 datum (i.e., World Geodetic System of 1984) uses the center of the earth as the origin \\nof the GCS and is used for defining locations across the globe. Because the datum uses the center of the \\nearth as its origin, locational measurements tend to be more consistent regardless where th ey are \\nobtained on the earth, though they may be less accurate than those returned by a local datum. Note that \\nswitching between datums will alter the coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) for all locations of \\ninterest. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  45 \\nMap Projections \\nPreviously we noted that the earth is really big. Not only is it big, but it is a big round spherical shape \\ncalled a spheroid. A globe is a very common and very good representation of the three- dimensional, \\nspheroid earth. One of the problems with globes, however, is that they are not very portable (i.e., you \\ncannot fold a globe and put in it in your pocket), and their small scale makes them of limited practical use \\n(i.e., geographic detail is sacrificed). To overcome these issues, it is necessary to transform the three -\\ndimensional shape of the earth to a two-dimensional surface like a flat piece of paper, computer screen, or \\nmobile device display in order to obtain more useful map forms and map scales. Enter the map projection.  \\nMap projections refer to the methods and procedures that are used to transform the spherical three-\\ndimensional earth into two-dimensional planar surfaces. Specifically, map projections are mathematical \\nformulas that are used to translate latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth to  x and y \\ncoordinates on a plane. Since there are an infinite number of ways this translation can be performed, \\nthere are an infinite number of map projections. The mathematics behind map projections are beyond the \\nscope of this introductory overview (but see Robinson et al. 1995; Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998), [1] and \\nfor simplicity, the following discussion focuses on describing types of map projections, the distortions \\ninherent to map projections, and the selection of appropriate map projections.  \\nTo illustrate the concept of a map projection, imagine that we place a light bulb in the center of a \\ntranslucent globe. On the globe are outlines of the continents and the lines of longitude and latitude called \\nthe graticule. When we turn the light bulb on, the outline of the continents and the graticule will be \\n\u201cprojected\u201d as shadows on the wall, ceiling, or any other nearby surface. This is what is meant by map \\n\u201cprojection.\u201d \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  46 \\nFigure 2.10 The Concept of Map \u201cProjection\u201d \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps and mapping, there are three surfaces used for map projections (i.e., surfaces \\non which we project the shadows of the graticule). These surfaces are the plane, the cylinder, and the \\ncone. Referring again to the previous example of a light bulb in the center of a globe, note that during the \\nprojection process, we can situate each surface in any number of ways. For example, surfaces can be \\ntangential to the globe along the equator or poles, they can pass through or intersect the surfa ce, and they \\ncan be oriented at any number of angles. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  47 \\nFigure 2.11 Map Projection Surfaces \\n \\nIn fact, naming conventions for many map projections include the surface as well as its orientation. For \\nexample, as the name suggests, \u201cplanar\u201d projections use the plane, \u201ccylindrical\u201d projections use cylinders, \\nand \u201cconic\u201d projections use the cone. For cylindrical projections, the \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d aspect refers \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  48 \\nto when the cylinder is tangential to the equator (i.e., the axis of the cylinder is oriented north \u2013south). \\nWhen the axis of the cylinder is perfectly oriented east\u2013west, the aspect is called \u201ctransverse,\u201d and all \\nother orientations are referred to as \u201coblique.\u201d Regardless the orientation or the surface on which a \\nprojection is based, a number of distortions will be introduced that will influence the choice of map \\nprojection. \\nWhen moving from the three-dimensional surface of the earth to a two-dimensional plane, distortions are \\nnot only introduced but also inevitable. Generally, map projections introduce  distortions in distance, \\nangles, and areas. Depending on the purpose of the map, a series of trade -offs will need to be made with \\nrespect to such distortions. \\nMap projections that accurately represent distances are referred to as equidistant projections. Note that \\ndistances are only correct in one direction, usually running north\u2013south, and are not correct everywhere \\nacross the map. Equidistant maps are frequently used for small-scale maps that cover large areas because \\nthey do a good job of preserving the shape of geographic features such as continents. \\nMaps that represent angles between locations, also referred to as bearings, are called conformal. \\nConformal map projections are used for navigational purposes due to the importance of maintaining a \\nbearing or heading when traveling great distances. The cost of preserving bearings is that areas tend to be \\nquite distorted in conformal map projections. Though shapes are more or less preserved over small areas, \\nat small scales areas become wildly distorted. The Mercator projection is an example of a conformal \\nprojection and is famous for distorting Greenland. \\nAs the name indicates, equal area or equivalent projections preserve the quality of area. Such projections \\nare of particular use when accurate measures or comparisons of geographical distributions are necessary \\n(e.g., deforestation, wetlands). In an effort to maintain true proportions in the surface of the earth, \\nfeatures sometimes become compressed or stretched depending on the orientation of the projection.  \\nMoreover, such projections distort distances as well as angular relationships.  \\nAs noted earlier, there are theoretically an infinite number of map projections to choose from. One of the \\nkey considerations behind the choice of map projection is to reduce the amount of distortion. The \\ngeographical object being mapped and the respective scale at which the map will be constructed are also Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  49 \\nimportant factors to think about. For instance, maps of the North and South Poles usually use planar or \\nazimuthal projections, and conical projections are best suited for the middle latitude areas of the earth. \\nFeatures that stretch east\u2013west, such as the country of Russia, are represented well with the standard \\ncylindrical projection, while countries oriented north\u2013south (e.g., Chile, Norway) are better represented \\nusing a transverse projection. \\nIf a map projection is unknown, sometimes it can be identified by working backward and examining \\nclosely the nature and orientation of the graticule (i.e., grid of latitude and longitu de), as well as the \\nvarying degrees of distortion. Clearly, there are trade-offs made with regard to distortion on every map. \\nThere are no hard-and-fast rules as to which distortions are more preferred over others. Therefore, the \\nselection of map projection largely depends on the purpose of the map. \\nWithin the scope of GISs, knowing and understanding map projections are critical. For instance, in order \\nto perform an overlay analysis like the one described earlier, all map layers need to be in the same \\nprojection. If they are not, geographical features will not be aligned properly, and any analyses performed \\nwill be inaccurate and incorrect. Most GISs include functions to assist in the identification of map \\nprojections, as well as to transform between projections in order to synchronize spatial data. Despite the \\ncapabilities of technology, an awareness of the potential and pitfalls that surround map projections is \\nessential. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map scale refers to the factor by which the real world is reduced to fit on a map.  \\n\u2022 A GIS is multiscalar. \\n\u2022 Map projections are mathematical formulas used to transform the three -dimensional earth to two \\ndimensions (e.g., paper maps, computer monitors). \\n\u2022 Map projections introduce distortions in distance, direction, and area.  \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the decision-making process behind maps and to underscore \\nthe need to be explicit and consistent when mapping and using geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nAs previously discussed, maps are a representation of the earth. Central to this representation is the \\nreduction of the earth and its features of interest to a manageable size (i.e., map scale) and its \\ntransformation into a useful two-dimensional form (i.e., map projection). The choice of both map \\nscale and, to a lesser extent, map projection will influence the content and shape of the map. \\nIn addition to the seemingly objective decisions made behind the choices of map scale and map \\nprojection are those concerning what to include and what to omit from the map. The purpose of a \\nmap will certainly guide some of these decisions, but other choices may be based on factors such as \\nspace limitations, map complexity, and desired accuracy. Furthermore, decisions about how to \\nclassify, simplify, or exaggerate features and how to symbolize objects of interest simultaneously fall \\nunder the realms of art and science (Slocum et al. 2004). [1] \\nThe process of moving from the \u201creal world\u201d to the world of maps is referred to as map abstraction. \\nThis process not only involves making choices about how to represent features but also, more \\nimportant with regard to geographic information systems (GISs), requires us to be explicit, \\nconsistent, and precise in terms of defining and describing geographical features of interest. Failure \\nto be explicit, consistent, and precise will return incorrect; inconsistent; and error-prone maps, \\nanalyses, and decisions based on such maps and GISs. This final section discusses map abstraction in \\nterms of geographical features and their respective graphical representation. \\nWhat Is a Forest? \\nOne of the most pressing environmental issues facing the world is deforestation. Generally, deforestation \\nrefers to the reduction of forest area. This is an important issue because it has possible implications for \\nclimate change, global warming, biodiversity, and the water balance of the earth, among other things. In \\nthe last century, deforestation has increased at an alarming rate and is mostly attributed to human Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  52 \\nactivity. Mapping forests regularly with a GIS is a logical way to monitor deforestation and has the \\npotential to inform policies regarding forest conservation efforts. Easy enough, so let\u2019s get started. \\nSo what exactly is a forest? How do we know where a forest begins and where it ends? How can naturally \\ncaused forest fires be differentiated from those started by humans? Can a forest exist in a swamp or \\nwetland? For that matter, what is the difference between a swamp and wetland? Such questions are  not \\ntrivial in the context of mapping and GISs. In fact, consistent and precise definitions of features like \\nforests or swamps increase the reliability and efficiency of maps, mapping, and analysis with GISs.  \\nFigure 2.12 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2001 \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  53 \\nFigure 2.13 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2009 \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps, cartography, and GISs, the world is made up of various features or entities. \\nSuch entities include but are not restricted to fire hydrants, caves, roads, rivers, lakes, hills, va lleys, \\noceans, and the occasional barn. Moreover, such features have a form, and more precisely, a geometric \\nform. For instance, fire hydrants and geysers are considered point-like features; rivers and streams are \\nlinear features; and lakes, countries, and forests are areal features. \\nFeatures can also be categorized as either discrete or continuous. Discrete  features are well defined and \\nare easy to locate, measure, and count, and their edges or boundaries are readily defined. Examples of \\ndiscrete features in a city include buildings, roads, traffic signals, and parks. Continuous  features, on the \\nother hand, are less well defined and exist across space. The most commonly cited examples of continuous \\nfeatures are temperature and elevation. Changes in both temperature and elevation tend to be gradual \\nover relatively large areas. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  54 \\nGeographical features also have several characteristics, traits, or attributes that may or may not be of \\ninterest. For instance, to continue the deforestation example, determining wheth er a forest is a rainforest \\nor whether a forest is in a protected park may be important. More general attributes may include \\nmeasurements such as tree density per acre, average canopy height in meters, or proportions like percent \\npalm trees or invasive species per hectare in the forest. \\nNotwithstanding the purpose of the map or GIS project at hand, it is critical that definitions of features \\nare clear and remain consistent. Similarly, it is important that the attributes of features are also \\nconsistently defined, measured, and reported in order to generate accurate and effective maps in an \\nefficient manner. Defining features and attributes of interest is often an iterative process of trial and error. \\nBeing able to associate a feature with a particular geometric form and to determine the fea ture type are \\ncentral to map abstraction, facilitate mapping, and the application of GISs.  \\nMap Content and Generalization \\nThe shape and content of maps vary according to purpose, need, and resources, among other factors. \\nWhat is common to most maps, and in particular to those within a GIS, is that they are graphical \\nrepresentations of reality. Put another way, various graphical symbols are used to represent geographical \\nfeatures or entities. Annotation or text is also commonly used on maps and facilitates m ap interpretation. \\nLearning about map content and map generalization is important because they serve as the building \\nblocks for spatial data that are used within a GIS. \\nBuilding upon the previous discussion about the geometric form of geographic features, maps typically \\nrely on three geometric objects: the point, the line, and the polygon or area. A point is defined \\nby x and y coordinates, a line is defined by two points, and a polygon is defined by a minimum of three \\npoints. The important thing to note is that the definition of a point is analogous to a location that is \\ndefined by longitude and latitude. Furthermore, since lines and polygons are made up of points, location \\ninformation (i.e., x and y, or longitude and latitude, coordinates) is intrinsic to points, lines, and polygons. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  55 \\nFigure 2.14 Geographic Features as Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nBoth simple and complex maps can be made using these three relatively simple geometric objects. \\nAdditionally, by changing the graphical characteristics of each object, an infinite number of mapping \\npossibilities emerge. Such changes can be made to the respective size, shape, color, and patterns of points, \\nlines, and polygons. For instance, different sized points can be used to reflect variations in population \\nsize, line color or line size (i.e., thickness) can be used to denote volume or the amount of interaction \\nbetween locations, and different colors and shapes can be used to reflect different values of interest.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  56 \\nFigure 2.15 Variations in the Graphical Parameters of Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nFigure 2.16 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  57 \\nComplementing the graphical elements described previously is annotation or text. Annotation is used to \\nidentify particular geographic features, such as cities, states, bodies of water, or other points of i nterest. \\nLike the graphical elements, text can be varied according to size, orientation, or color. There are also \\nnumerous text fonts and styles that are incorporated into maps. For example, bodies of water are often \\nlabeled in italics. \\nAnother map element that deserves to be mentioned and that combines both graphics and text is the map \\nlegend or map key. A map legend provides users information about the how geographic information is \\nrepresented graphically. Legends usually consist of a title that describes the map, as well as the various \\nsymbols, colors, and patterns that are used on the map. Such information is often vital to the proper \\ninterpretation of a map. \\nAs more features and graphical elements are put on a given map, the need to generalize such feat ures \\narises. Map generalization refers to the process of resolving conflicts associated with too much detail, too \\nmany features, or too much information to map. In particular, generalization can take several forms \\n(Buttenfield and McMaster 1991): [2] \\n\u2022 The simplification or symbolization of features for emphasis \\n\u2022 The masking or displacement of detail to increase clarity or legibility  \\n\u2022 The selection of detail for inclusion or omission from the map \\n\u2022 The exaggeration of features for emphasis \\nDetermining which aspects of generalization to use is largely a matter of personal preference, experience, \\nmap purpose, and trial and error. Though there are general guidelines about map generalization, there are \\nno universal standards or requirements with regard to the generalization of maps and mapping. It is at \\nthis point that cartographic and artistic license, prejudices and biases, and creativity and design sense \u2014 or \\nlack thereof\u2014 emerge to shape the map. \\nMaking a map and, more generally, the process of mapping involve a range of decisions and choices. From \\nthe selection of the appropriate map scale and map projection to deciding which features to map and to \\nomit, mapping is a complex blend of art and science. In fact, many historical maps are indeed viewed like \\nworks of art, and rightly so. Learning about the scale, shape, and content of maps serves to increase our Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  58 \\nunderstanding of maps, as well as deepen our appreciation of maps and map making. Ultimately, this \\nincreased geographical awareness and appreciation of maps promotes the sound and effective use and \\napplication of a GIS. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map abstraction refers to the process of explicitly defining and representing real -world features on a \\nmap. \\n\u2022 The three basic geometric forms of geographical features are the point, line, a nd polygon (or area). \\n\u2022 Map generalization refers to resolving conflicts that arise on a map due to limited space, too many \\ndetails, or too much information. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

What\u2019s more is that \\nthe process of mapping has also been decentralized and democratized so that many more people not \\nonly have access to maps but also are enabled and empowered to create their own maps. This \\ndemocratization of maps and mapping is in large part attributable to a shift to digital map \\nproduction and consumption. Unlike analog or hardcopy maps that are static or fixed once they are \\nprinted onto paper, digital maps are highly changeable, exchangeable, and as noted in Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", dynamic in terms of scale, form, and content. \\nTo understand digital maps and mapping, it is necessary to put them into the context of computing \\nand information technology. First, this chapter provides an introduction to the building blocks of \\ndigital maps and geographic information systems (GISs), with particular emphasis placed upon how \\ndata and information are stored as files on a computer. Second, key issues and considerations as they \\nrelate to data acquisition and data standards are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion \\nof where data for use with a GIS can be found.

The objective of this section is to define and describe data and information and how it is organized into \\nfiles for use in a computing and geographic information system (GIS) environment.  \\nTo understand how we get from analog to digital maps, let\u2019s begin with the building blocks and \\nfoundations of the geographic information system (GIS)\u2014 namely, data and information. As already \\nnoted on several occasions, GIS stores, edits, processes, and presents data and information. But what \\nexactly is data? And what exactly is information? For many, the terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d refer \\nto the same thing. For our purposes, it is useful to make a distinction between the two. \\nGenerally, data refer to facts, measurements, characteristics, or traits of an object of interest. For \\nyou grammar sticklers out there, note that \u201cdata\u201d is the plural form of \u201cdatum.\u201d For example, we can \\ncollect all kinds of data about all kinds of things, like the length of rainbow trout in a Colorado \\nstream, the number of vegetarians in Alaska, the diameter of mahogany tree trunks in the Brazilian \\nrainforest, student scores on the last GIS midterm, the altitude of mountain peaks in Nepal, the \\ndepth of snow in the Austrian Alps, or the number of people who use public transportation to get to \\nwork in London. \\nOnce data are put into context, used to answer questions, situated within analytical frameworks, or \\nused to obtain insights, they become information. For our purposes, information simply refers to \\nthe knowledge of value obtained through the collection, interpretation, and/or analysis of data. \\nThough a computer is not necessary to collect, record, manipulate, process, or visualize data, or to \\nprocess it into information, information technology can be of great help. For instance, computers can \\nautomate repetitive tasks, store data efficiently in terms of space and cost, and provide a range of \\ntools for analyzing data from spreadsheets to GISs, of course. What\u2019s more is the fact that the \\nincredible amount of data collected each and every day by satellites, grocery store product scanners, \\ntraffic sensors, temperature gauges, and your mobile phone carrier, to name just a few, would not be \\npossible without the aid and innovation of information technology. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  62 \\nSince this is a text about GISs, it is useful to also define geographic data. Like generic \\ndata, geographic or spatial data refer to geographic facts, measurements, or characteristics of an \\nobject that permit us to define its location on the surface of the earth. Such data include but are not \\nrestricted to the latitude and longitude coordinates of points of interest, street addresses, postal \\ncodes, political boundaries, and even the names of places of interest. It is also important to note and \\nreemphasize the difference between geographic data and attribute data, which was discussed \\nin Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". Where geographic data are concerned with defining the location of an \\nobject of interest, attribute data are concerned with its nongeographic traits and characteristics. \\nTo illustrate the distinction between geographic and attribute data, think about your home where \\nyou grew up or where you currently live. Within the context of this discussion, we can associate both \\ngeographic and attribute data to it. For instance, we can define the location of your home many ways, \\nsuch as with a street address, the street names of the nearest intersection, the postal code where your \\nhome is located, or we could use a global positioning system\u2013enabled device to obtain latitude and \\nlongitude coordinates. What is important is geographic data permit us to define the location of an \\nobject (i.e., your home) on the surface of the earth. \\nIn addition to the geographic data that define the location of your home are the attribute data that \\ndescribe the various qualities of your home. Such data include but are not restricted to the number of \\nbedrooms and bathrooms in your home, whether or not your home has central heat, the year when \\nyour home was built, the number of occupants, and whether or not there is a swimming pool. These \\nattribute data tell us a lot about your home but relatively little about where it is. \\nNot only is it useful to recognize and understand how geographic and attribute data differ and \\ncomplement each other, but it is also of central importance when learning about and using GISs. \\nBecause a GIS requires and integrates these two distinct types of data, being able to differentiate \\nbetween geographic and attribute data is the first step in organizing your GIS. Furthermore, being \\nable to determine which kinds of data you need will ultimately aid in your implementation and use of \\na GIS. More often than not, and in the age and context of information technology, the data and \\ninformation discussed thus far is the stuff of computer files, which are the focus of the next section. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  63 \\nOf Files and Formats\u2026 \\nWhen we collect data about your home, rainforests, or anything, really, we usually need to put them \\nsomewhere. Though we may scribble numbers and measures on the back of an envelope or write them \\ndown on a pad of paper, if we want to update, share, analyze, or map them in the future, it is often useful \\nto record them in digital form so a computer can read them. Though we won\u2019t bother ourselves with the \\nbits and bytes of computing, it is necessary to discuss some basic elements of computing that are both \\nrelevant and required when learning and working with a GIS. \\nOne of the most common elements of working with computers and computing itself is the file. Files in a \\ncomputer can contain any number of things from a complex set of instructions (e.g., a computer program) \\nto a list of numbers and letters (e.g., address book). Furthermore, computer files come in all different sizes \\nand types. One of the clues we can use to distinguish one file from another is the file extension. The file \\nextension refers to the letters that follow the period (\u201c.\u201d) after the name of the file. Table 3.1 contains some \\nof the most common file extensions and the types of files with which they are associated.  \\nTable 3.1 \\nfilename.txt Simple text file \\nfilename.doc Microsoft Word document \\nfilename.pdf Adobe portable document format \\nfilename.jpg Compressed image file \\nfilename.tif Tagged image format \\nfilename.html Hypertext markup language (used to create web pages) \\nfilename.xml Extensible markup language \\nfilename.zip Zipped/compressed archive \\nSome computer programs may be able to read or work with only certain file types, while others are more \\nadept at reading multiple file formats. What you will realize as you begin to work  more with information \\ntechnology, and GISs in particular, is that familiarity with different file types is important. Learning how \\nto convert or export one file type to another is also a very useful and valuable skill to obtain. In this \\nregard, being able to recognize and knowing how to identify different and unfamiliar file types will \\nundoubtedly increase your proficiency with computers and GISs. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  64 \\nOf the numerous file types that exist, one of the most common and widely accessed file is the simple \\ntext, plain text, or just text file. Simple text files can be read widely by word processing programs, \\nspreadsheet and database programs, and web browsers. Often ending with the extension \u201c.txt\u201d \\n(i.e.,filename.txt), text files contain no special formatting (e.g., bold, italic, underlining) and contain only \\nalphanumeric characters. In other words, images or complex graphics are not well suited for text files. \\nText files, however, are ideal for recording, sharing, and exchanging data because most computers and \\noperating systems can recognize and read simple text files with programs called text editors.  \\nWhen a text file contains data that are organized or structured in some fashion, it is sometimes called a \\nflat file (but the file extension remains the same, i.e., .txt). Generally, flat files are organized in a tabular \\nformat or line by line. In other words, each line or row of the file contains one and only one record. So if \\nwe collected height measurements on three people, Tim, Jake, and Harry, the file might look som ething \\nlike this: \\nName Height \\nTim 6\u20191\u201d \\nJake 5\u20199\u201d \\nHarry 6\u20192\u201d \\nEach row corresponds to one and only one record, observation or case. There are two other important \\nelements to know about this file. First, note that the first row does not contain any data; rather, it provides \\na description of the data contained in each column. When the first row of a file contains such descriptors, \\nit is referred to as a header row or just a header. Columns in a flat file are also called \\nfields, variables, or attributes. \u201cHeight\u201d is the attribute, field, or variable that we are interested in, and \\nthe observations or cases in our data set are \u201cTim,\u201d \u201cJake,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d In short, rows are for records; \\ncolumns are for fields. \\nThe second unseen but critical element to the file is the spaces in between each column or field. In the \\nexample, it appears as though a space separates the \u201cname\u201d column from the \u201cheight\u201d column. Upon \\ncloser inspection, however, note how the initial values of the \u201cheight\u201d column are aligned. If a single space \\nwas being used to separate each column, the height column would not be aligned. In this case a tab is \\nbeing used to separate the columns of each row. The character that is used to separate columns within a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  65 \\nflat file is called the delimiter or separator. Though any character can be used as a delimiter, the most \\ncommon delimiters are the tab, the comma, and a single space. The following are examples of each.  \\nTab-Delimited Single-Space-Delimited Comma-Delimited \\nName     Height Name Height Name, Height \\nTim     6.1 Tim 6.1 Tim, 6.1 \\nJake     5.9 Jake 5.9 Jake, 5.9 \\nHarry     6.2 Harry 6.2 Harry, 6.2 \\nKnowing the delimiter to a flat file is important because it enables us to distinguish and separate the \\ncolumns efficiently and without error. Sometimes such files are referred to by their delimiter, such as a \\n\u201ccomma-separated values\u201d file or a \u201ctab-delimited\u201d file. \\nWhen recording and working with geographic data, the same general format is applied. Rows are reserved \\nfor records, or in the case of geographic data, locations and columns or fields are used for the attributes or \\nvariables associated with each location. For example, the following tab-delimited flat file contains data for \\nthree places (i.e., countries) and three attributes or characteristics of eac h country (i.e., population, \\nlanguage, continent) as noted by the header. \\nCountry Population Language Continent \\nFrance 65,000,000 French Europe \\nBrazil 192,000,000 Portuguese South America \\nAustralia 22,000,000 English Australia \\nFiles like those presented here are the building blocks of the various tables, charts, reports, graphs, and \\nother visualizations that we see each and every day online, in print, and on television. They are also key \\ncomponents to the maps and geographic representations created by GISs. Rarely if ever, however, will you \\nwork with one and only one file or file type. More often than not, and especially when working with GISs, \\nyou will work with multiple files. Such a grouping of multiple files is called a  database. Since the files \\nwithin a database may be different sizes, shapes, and even formats, we need to devise some type of system \\nthat will allow us to work, update, edit, integrate, share, and display the various data within the database. \\nSuch a system is generally referred to as a database management system (DBMS). Databases and DBMSs \\nare so important to GISs that a later chapter is dedicated to them. For now it is enough to remember that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  66 \\nfile types are like ice cream\u2014 they come in all different kinds of flavors. In light of such variety, Section 3.2 \\n\"Data about Data\" details some of the key issues that need to be considered when acquiring and working \\nwith data and information for GISs. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Data refer to specific facts, measurements, or characteristics of objects and phenomena of interest.  \\n\u2022 Information refers to knowledge of value that is obtained from the analysis of data.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the difference between primary and secondary data sources \\nand to understand the importance of metadata and data standards.  \\nConsider the following comma-delimited file: \\ncity, sun, temp, precip \\nLos Angeles, 300, 70, 10 \\nLondon, 50, 55, 40 \\nSingapore, 330, 80, 60 \\nLooking at the contents of the file, we can see that it contains data about the cities of Los Angeles, \\nLondon, and Singapore. As noted, each field or attribute is separated by a comma, and the file also \\ncontains a header row that tells us about the data contained in each column. Or does it? What does \\nthe column \u201csun\u201d refer to? Is it the number of sunny days this year, last year, annually, or when? \\nWhat about \u201ctemp\u201d? Does this refer to the average daytime, evening, or annual temperature? For \\nthat matter, how is temperature measured? In Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin? The column \u201cprecip\u201d \\nprobably refers to precipitation, but again, what are the units or time frame for such measures and \\ndata? Finally, where did these data come from? Who collected them, when were they collected and \\nfor what purpose? \\nIt is amazing to think that such a small text file can lead to so many questions. Now let\u2019s extend the \\nexample to a file with one hundred records on ten variables, one thousand records on one hundred \\nvariables or better yet, ten thousand records on one thousand variables. Through this rather simple \\nexample, a number of general but central issues that are related to data emerge. Such issues range \\nfrom the relatively mundane naming conventions that are used to identify individual records (i.e., \\nrows) and distinguish one field (i.e., column) from another, to the issue of providing documentation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  68 \\nabout what data are included in a given file; when the data were collected; for what purpose are the \\ndata to be used; who collected them; and, of course, where did the data come from? \\nThe previous simple text file illustrates how we cannot and should not take data and information for \\ngranted. It also highlights two important concepts with regard to the source of data and to the \\ncontents of data files. With regard to data sources, data can be put into one of two distinct categories. \\nThe first category is called primary data. Primary data refer to data that are collected directly or on a \\nfirsthand basis. For example, if you wanted to examine the variability of local temperatures in the \\nmonth of May, and you recorded the temperature at noon every day in May, you would be \\nconstructing a primary data set. Conversely, secondary data refer to data collected by someone else or \\nsome other party. For instance, when we work with census or economic data collected and \\ndistributed by the government, we are using secondary data. \\nSeveral factors influence the decision behind the construction and use of primary data sets versus \\nsecondary data sets. Among the most important factors are the costs associated with data acquisition \\nin terms of money, availability, and time. In fact, the data acquisition and integration phase of most \\ngeographic information system (GIS) projects is often the most time consuming. In other words, \\nlocating, obtaining, and putting together the data to be used for a GIS project, whether you collect \\nthe data yourself or use secondary data, may indeed take up most of your time. Of course, depending \\non the purpose, availability, and need, it may not be necessary to construct an entirely new data set \\n(i.e., primary data set). In light of the vast amounts of data and information that are publicly \\navailable, for example, via the Internet, the cost and time savings of using secondary data often offset \\nany benefits that are associated with primary data collection. \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of the difference between primary and secondary data, as \\nwell as the rationale behind each, how do we go about finding the data and information that we \\nneed? As noted earlier, there is an incredibly vast and growing amount of data and information \\navailable to us, and performing an online search for \u201cdeforestation data\u201d will return hundreds\u2014 if not \\nthousands\u2014 of results. To overcome this data and information overload we need to turn to\u2026even \\nmore data. In particular, we are looking for a special kind of data called metadata. Simply defined, \\nmetadata are data about data. At one level, a header row in a simple text file like those discussed in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  69 \\nthe previous section is analogous to metadata. The header row provides data (e.g., names and labels) \\nabout the subsequent rows of data. \\nHeader rows themselves, however, may need additional explanation as previously illustrated. \\nFurthermore, when working with or searching through several data sets, it can be quite tedious at \\nbest or impossible at worst to open each and every file in order to determine its contents and \\nusability. Enter metadata. Today many files, and in particular secondary data sets, come with a \\nmetadata file. These metadata files contain items such as general descriptions about the contents of \\nthe file, definitions for the various terms used to identify records (rows) and fields (fields), the range \\nof values for fields, the quality or reliability of the data and measurements, how the data were \\ncollected, when the data were collected, and who collected the data. Though not all data are \\naccompanied by metadata, it is easy to see and understand why metadata are important and valuable \\nwhen searching for secondary data, as well as when constructing primary data that may be shared in \\nthe future. \\nJust as simple files come in all shapes, sizes, and formats, so too do metadata. As the amount and \\navailability of data and information increase each and every day, metadata play a critical role in \\nmaking sense of it all. The class of metadata that we are most concerned with when working with a \\nGIS is calledgeospatial metadata. As the name suggests, geospatial metadata are data about \\ngeographical and spatial data. According to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in the \\nUnited States (see http://www.fgdc.gov), \u201cGeospatial metadata are used to document geographic \\ndigital resources such as GIS files, geospatial databases, and earth imagery. A geospatial metadata \\nrecord includes core library catalog elements such as Title, Abstract, and Publication Data; \\ngeographic elements such as Geographic Extent and Projection Information; and database elements \\nsuch as Attribute Label Definitions and Attribute Domain Values.\u201d The definition of geospatial \\nmetadata is about improving transparency when it comes to data, as well as promoting standards. \\nTake a few moments to explore and examine the contents of a geospatial metadata file that conforms \\nto the FGDC here. \\nGenerally, standards refer to widely promoted, accepted, and followed rules and practices. Given the \\nrange and variability of data and data sources, identifying a common thread to locate and understand Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  70 \\nthe contents of any given file can be a challenge. Just as the rules of grammar and mathematics \\nprovide the foundations for communication and numeric calculations, respectively, metadata \\nprovide similar frameworks for working with and sharing data and information from various \\nsources. \\nThe central point behind metadata is that it facilitates data and information sharing. Within the \\ncontext of large organizations such as governments, data and information sharing can eliminate \\nredundancies and increase efficiencies. Moreover, access to data and information promotes the \\nintegration of different data that can improve analyses, inform decisions, and shape policy. The role \\nthat metadata\u2014 and in particular geospatial metadata\u2014 play in the world of GISs is critical and offers \\nenormous benefits in terms of cost and time savings. It is precisely the sharing, widespread \\ndistribution and integration of various geographic and nongeographic data and information, enabled \\nby metadata, that drive some of the most interesting and compelling innovations in GISs and the \\nbroader geospatial information technology community. More important, widespread access, \\ndistribution, and sharing of geographic data and information have important social costs and \\nbenefits and yield better analyses and more informed decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Primary data refer to data that are obtained via direct observation or measure, and secondary data refer \\nto data collected by a different party. \\n\u2022 Data acquisition is among the most time-consuming aspects of any GIS project. \\n\u2022 Metadata are data about data and promote data exchange, dissemination, and integration.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the costs and benefits of using primary data instead of secondary data?  \\n2. Refer to the Federal Geographic Data Committee website (http://www.fgdc.gov) and describe in detail \\nwhat information should be included in a metadata file. Why are metadata and standards important?  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  71 \\n3.3 Finding Data \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to identify and evaluate key considerations when searching for data.  \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of data and information, where can we find such data and \\ninformation? Though an Internet search will certainly come up with myriad sources and types of \\ndata, the hunt for relevant and useful data is often a challenging and iterative process. Therefore, \\nprior to hopping online and downloading the first thing that appears from a web search, it is useful \\nto frame our search for data with the following questions and considerations: \\n1. What exactly is the purpose of the data? Given the fact the world is swimming in va st amounts of \\ndata, articulating why we need (or why we don\u2019t need) a given set of data will streamline the \\nsearch for useful and relevant data. To this end, the more specific we can be about the purpose of \\nthe needed data, the more efficient our search for data will be. For example, if we are interested in \\nunderstanding and studying economic growth, it is useful to determine both temporal and \\ngeographic scales. In other words, for what time periods (e.g., 1850 \u20131900) and intervals (e.g., \\nquarterly, annually) are we interested, and at what level of analysis (e.g., national, regional, \\nstate)? Oftentimes, data availability, or more specifically, the lack of relevant data, will force us to \\nchange the purpose or scope of our original question. A clear purpose will yield a more efficient \\nsearch for data and enables us to accept or discard quickly the various data sets that we may come \\nacross. \\n2. The second question we need to ask ourselves is what data already exist and to what data do we \\nhave access already? Prior to searching for new data, it is always a good idea to take an inventory \\nof the data that we already have. Such data may be from previous projects or analyses, or from \\ncolleagues and classmates, but the key point here is that we can save a lot of time and ef fort by \\nusing data that we already possess. Furthermore, by identifying what we have, we get a better \\nunderstanding of what we need. For instance, though we may already have census data (i.e., \\nattribute data), we may need updated geographic data that conta ins the boundaries of US states \\nor counties. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  72 \\n3. Next, we need to assess and evaluate the costs associated with data acquisition. Data acquisition \\ncosts go beyond financial costs. Just as important as the financial costs to data are those that \\ninvolve your time. After all, time is money. The time and energy you spend on collecting, finding, \\ncleaning, and formatting data are time and energy taken away from data analysis. Depending on \\ndeadlines, time constraints, and deliverables, it is critical to learn how to m anage your time when \\nlooking for data. \\n4. Finally, the format of the data that is needed is of critical importance. Though many programs can \\nread many formats of data, there are some data types that can only be read by some programs and \\nsome programs that require particular data formats. Understanding what data formats you can \\nuse and those that you cannot will aid in your search for data. For instance, one of the most \\ncommon forms of geographic information system (GIS) data is called the  shapefile. Not all GIS \\nprograms can read or use shapefiles, but it may be necessary to convert to or from a shapefile or \\nsome other format. Hence, as noted earlier, the more data formats with which we are familiar, the \\nbetter off we will be in our search for data because we will have an understanding of not only what \\nwe can use but also what format conversions will need to be made if necessary.  \\nAll these questions are of equal importance and being able to answer them will assist in a more \\nefficient and effective search for data. Obviously, there are several other considerations behind the \\nsearch for data, and in particular GIS data, but those listed here provide an initial pathway to a \\nsuccessful search for data. \\nAs information technology evolves, and as more and more data are collected and distributed, the \\nvarious forms of data that can be used with a GIS increases. Generally, and as discussed previously, a \\nGIS uses and integrates two types of data: geographic data and attribute data. Sometimes the source \\nof both geographic and attribute data are one in the same. For instance, the US Bureau of Census \\n(http://www.census.gov) distributes geographic boundary files (e.g., census tract level, county level, \\nstate level) as well as the associated attribute data (e.g., population, race/ethnicity, income). What\u2019s \\nmore is that such data are freely available at no charge. In many respects, US census data are \\nexceptional: they are free and comprehensive. If only all data were free and comprehensive! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  73 \\nObviously, each and every search for data will vary according to purpose, but data from governments \\ntend to have good coverage and provide a point of reference from which other data can be added, \\ncompared, and evaluated. Whether you need satellite imagery data from the National Aeronautics \\nand Space Administration (http://www.nasa.gov) or land use data from the United States Geological \\nSurvey (http://www.usgs.gov), such government sources tend to be reliable, reputable, and \\nconsistent. Another key element of most government data is that they are freely accessible to the \\npublic. In other words, there is no charge to use or to acquire the data. Data that are free to use are \\ngenerally called public data. \\nUnlike publicly available data, there are numerous sources of private or proprietary data. The main \\ndifference between public and private data is that the former tend to be free, and the latter must be \\nacquired at a cost. Furthermore, there are often restrictions on the redistribution and dissemination \\nof proprietary data sets (i.e., sharing the purchased data is not allowed). Again, depending on the \\nsubject matter, proprietary data may be the only option. Another reason for using proprietary data is \\nthat the data may be formatted and cleaned according to your needs. The trade-off between financial \\ncost and time saved is one that must be seriously considered and evaluated when working with \\ndeadlines. \\nThe search for data, and in particular the data that you need, is often the most time consuming \\naspect of any GIS-related project. Therefore, it is critical to try to define and clarify your data \\nrequirements and needs\u2014 from the temporal and geographic scales of data to the formats required\u2014\\nas clearly as possible and as early as possible. Such definition and clarity will pay dividends in your \\nsearch for the right data, which in turn will yield better analyses and well-informed decisions. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n\u2022 Prior to searching for data, ask yourself the following questions: Why do I need the data? At what time \\nscale do I need the data? At what geographic scale do I want the data? What data already exist? What \\nformat do I need the data? \\n \\nEXERCISES  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  74 \\n1.

Data models are a set of rules and/or constructs used to describe and represent aspects of the \\nreal world in a computer. Two primary data models are available to complete this task: raster data \\nmodels and vector data models. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  76 \\n4.1 Raster Data Models \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to understand how raster data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nThe raster data model is widely used in applications ranging far beyond geographic information \\nsystems (GISs). Most likely, you are already very familiar with this data model if you have any \\nexperience with digital photographs. The ubiquitous JPEG, BMP, and TIFF file formats (among \\nothers) are based on the raster data model (see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section \\n5.3 \"File Formats\"). Take a moment to view your favorite digital image. If you zoom deeply into the \\nimage, you will notice that it is composed of an array of tiny square pixels (or picture elements). Each \\nof these uniquely colored pixels, when viewed as a whole, combines to form a coherent image (Figure \\n4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nFigure 4.1 Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image \\n \\nFurthermore, all liquid crystal display (LCD) computer monitors are based on raster technology as \\nthey are composed of a set number of rows and columns of pixels. Notably, the foundation of this \\ntechnology predates computers and digital cameras by nearly a century. The neoimpressionist artist, \\nGeorges Seurat, developed a painting technique referred to as \u201cpointillism\u201d in the 1880s, which \\nsimilarly relies on the amassing of small, monochromatic \u201cdots\u201d of ink that combine to form a larger \\nimage (Figure 4.2 \"Pointillist Artwork\"). If you are as generous as the author, you may indeed think \\nof your raster dataset creations as sublime works of art. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  77 \\nFigure 4.2 Pointillist Artwork \\n \\nThe raster data model consists of rows and columns of equally sized pixels interconnected to form a \\nplanar surface. These pixels are used as building blocks for creating points, lines, areas, networks, \\nand surfaces (Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Figure 2.6 \"Map Overlay Process\" illustrates how a land \\nparcel can be converted to a raster representation). Although pixels may be triangles, hexagons, or \\neven octagons, square pixels represent the simplest geometric form with which to work. Accordingly, \\nthe vast majority of available raster GIS data are built on the square pixel (Figure 4.3 \"Common \\nRaster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and USGS DEM (right)\"). These \\nsquares are typically reformed into rectangles of various dimensions if the data model is transformed \\nfrom one projection to another (e.g., from State Plane coordinates to UTM [Universal Transverse \\nMercator] coordinates). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  78 \\nFigure 4.3 Common Raster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and \\nUSGS DEM (right) \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nBecause of the reliance on a uniform series of square pixels, the raster data model is referred to as a \\ngrid-based system. Typically, a single data value will be assigned to each grid locale. Each cell in a \\nraster carries a single value, which represents the characteristic of the spatial phenomenon at a \\nlocation denoted by its row and column. The data type for that cell value can be either integer or \\nfloating-point (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1 \"Geographic Data \\nAcquisition\"). Alternatively, the raster graphic can reference a database management system wherein \\nopen-ended attribute tables can be used to associate multiple data values to each pixel. The advance \\nof computer technology has made this second methodology increasingly feasible as large datasets are \\nno longer constrained by computer storage issues as they were previously. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  79 \\nThe raster model will average all values within a given pixel to yield a single value. Therefore, the \\nmore area covered per pixel, the less accurate the associated data values. The area covered by each \\npixel determines thespatial resolution of the raster model from which it is derived. Specifically, \\nresolution is determined by measuring one side of the square pixel. A raster model with pixels \\nrepresenting 10 m by 10 m (or 100 square meters) in the real world would be said to have a spatial \\nresolution of 10 m; a raster model with pixels measuring 1 km by 1 km (1 square kilometer) in the \\nreal world would be said to have a spatial resolution of 1 km; and so forth. \\nCare must be taken when determining the resolution of a raster because using an overly coarse pixel \\nresolution will cause a loss of information, whereas using overly fine pixel resolution will result in \\nsignificant increases in file size and computer processing requirements during display and/or \\nanalysis. An effective pixel resolution will take both the map scale and the minimum mapping unit of \\nthe other GIS data into consideration. In the case of raster graphics with coarse spatial resolution, \\nthe data values associated with specific locations are not necessarily explicit in the raster data model. \\nFor example, if the location of telephone poles were mapped on a coarse raster graphic, it would be \\nclear that the entire cell would not be filled by the pole. Rather, the pole would be assumed to be \\nlocated somewhere within that cell (typically at the center). \\nImagery employing the raster data model must exhibit several properties. First, each pixel must hold \\nat least one value, even if that data value is zero. Furthermore, if no data are present for a given pixel, \\na data value placeholder must be assigned to this grid cell. Often, an arbitrary, readily identifiable \\nvalue (e.g., \u22129999) will be assigned to pixels for which there is no data value. Second, a cell can hold \\nany alphanumeric index that represents an attribute. In the case of quantitative datasets, attribute \\nassignation is fairly straightforward. For example, if a raster image denotes elevation, the data values \\nfor each pixel would be some indication of elevation, usually in feet or meters. In the case of \\nqualitative datasets, data values are indices that necessarily refer to some predetermined \\ntranslational rule. In the case of a land-use/land-cover raster graphic, the following rule may be \\napplied: 1 = grassland, 2 = agricultural, 3 = disturbed, and so forth (Figure 4.4 \"Land-Use/Land-\\nCover Raster Image\"). The third property of the raster data model is that points and lines \u201cmove\u201d to \\nthe center of the cell. As one might expect, if a 1 km resolution raster image contains a river or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  80 \\nstream, the location of the actual waterway within the \u201criver\u201d pixel will be unclear. Therefore, there is \\na general assumption that all zero-dimensional (point) and one-dimensional (line) features will be \\nlocated toward the center of the cell. As a corollary, the minimum width for any line feature must \\nnecessarily be one cell regardless of the actual width of the feature. If it is not, the feature will not be \\nrepresented in the image and will therefore be assumed to be absent. \\nFigure 4.4 Land-Use/Land-Cover Raster Image \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  81 \\nSeveral methods exist for encoding raster data from scratch. Three of these models are as follows: \\n1. Cell-by-cell raster encoding. This minimally intensive method encodes a raster by creating \\nrecords for each cell value by row and column (Figure 4.5 \"Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThis method could be thought of as a large spreadsheet wherein each cell of the spreadsheet \\nrepresents a pixel in the raster image. This method is also referred to as \u201cexhaustive \\nenumeration.\u201d \\n2. Run-length raster encoding. This method encodes cell values in runs of similarly valued pixels \\nand can result in a highly compressed image file (Figure 4.6 \"Run-Length Encoding of Raster \\nData\"). The run-length encoding method is useful in situations where large groups of neighboring \\npixels have similar values (e.g., discrete datasets such as land use/land cover or habitat \\nsuitability) and is less useful where neighboring pixel values vary widely (e.g., continuous datasets \\nsuch as elevation or sea-surface temperatures). \\n3. Quad-tree raster encoding. This method divides a raster into a hierarchy of quadrants that are \\nsubdivided based on similarly valued pixels (Figure 4.7 \"Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThe division of the raster stops when a quadrant is made entirely from cells of the same value. A \\nquadrant that cannot be subdivided is called a \u201cleaf node.\u201d \\nFigure 4.5 Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  82 \\nFigure 4.6 Run-Length Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  83 \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Raster Model \\nThe use of a raster data model confers many advantages. First, the technology required to create raster \\ngraphics is inexpensive and ubiquitous. Nearly everyone currently owns some sort of raster image \\ngenerator, namely a digital camera, and few cellular phones are sold today that don\u2019t include such \\nfunctionality. Similarly, a plethora of satellites are constantly beaming up -to-the-minute raster graphics \\nto scientific facilities across the globe (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3 \"File \\nFormats\"). These graphics are often posted online for private and/or public use, occasionally at no cost to \\nthe user. \\nAdditional advantages of raster graphics are the relative simplicity of the underlying data structure. Each \\ngrid location represented in the raster image correlates to a single value (or series of values if attributes \\ntables are included). This simple data structure may also help explain why it is relatively easy to perform \\noverlay analyses on raster data (for more on overlay analyses, see Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector \\nOperations\", Section 7.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\"). This simplicity also lends itself to easy interpretation \\nand maintenance of the graphics, relative to its vector counterpart.  \\nDespite the advantages, there are also several disadvantages to using the raster data model. The first \\ndisadvantage is that raster files are typically very large. Particu larly in the case of raster images built from \\nthe cell-by-cell encoding methodology, the sheer number of values stored for a given dataset result in \\npotentially enormous files. Any raster file that covers a large area and has somewhat finely resolved pixel s \\nwill quickly reach hundreds of megabytes in size or more. These large files are only getting larger as the \\nquantity and quality of raster datasets continues to keep pace with quantity and quality of computer \\nresources and raster data collectors (e.g., digital cameras, satellites). \\nA second disadvantage of the raster model is that the output images are less \u201cpretty\u201d than their vector \\ncounterparts. This is particularly noticeable when the raster images are enlarged or zoomed (refer \\nto Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\" ). Depending on how \\nfar one zooms into a raster image, the details and coherence of that image will quickly be lost amid a \\npixilated sea of seemingly randomly colored grid cells. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  84 \\nThe geometric transformations that arise during map reprojection efforts can cause problems for raster \\ngraphics and represent a third disadvantage to using the raster data model. As described in  Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.2 \"Map Scale, Coordinate Systems, and Map Projections\", changing map \\nprojections will alter the size and shape of the original input layer and frequently result in the loss or \\naddition of pixels (White 2006). [1] These alterations will result in the perfect square pixels of the input \\nlayer taking on some alternate rhomboidal dimensions. However, the problem is larger than a simple \\nreformation of the square pixel. Indeed, the reprojection of a raster image dataset from one projection to \\nanother brings change to pixel values that may, in turn, significantly alter the output information (Seong \\n2003). [2] \\nThe final disadvantage of using the raster data model is that it is not suitable for some types of spatial \\nanalyses. For example, difficulties arise when attempting to overlay and analyze multiple raster  graphics \\nproduced at differing scales and pixel resolutions. Combining information from a raster image with 10 m \\nspatial resolution with a raster image with 1 km spatial resolution will most likely produce nonsensical \\noutput information as the scales of analysis are far too disparate to result in meaningful and/or \\ninterpretable conclusions. In addition, some network and spatial analyses (i.e., determining directionality \\nor geocoding) can be problematic to perform on raster data. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Raster data are derived from a grid-based system of contiguous cells containing specific attribute \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The spatial resolution of a raster dataset represents a measure of the accuracy or detail of the displayed \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The raster data model is widely used by non-GIS technologies such as digital cameras/pictures and LCD \\nmonitors. \\n\u2022 Care should be taken to determine whether the raster or vector data model is best suited for your data \\nand/or analytical needs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how vector data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nIn contrast to the raster data model is the vector data model. In this model, space is not quantized \\ninto discrete grid cells like the raster model. Vector data models use points and their associated X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs to represent the vertices of spatial features, much as if they were being drawn on a \\nmap by hand (Aronoff 1989). [1] The data attributes of these features are then stored in a separate \\ndatabase management system. The spatial information and the attribute information for these \\nmodels are linked via a simple identification number that is given to each feature in a map. \\nThree fundamental vector types exist in geographic information systems (GISs): points, lines, and \\npolygons (Figure 4.8 \"Points, Lines, and Polygons\"). Points are zero-dimensional objects that contain \\nonly a single coordinate pair. Points are typically used to model singular, discrete features such as \\nbuildings, wells, power poles, sample locations, and so forth. Points have only the property of \\nlocation. Other types of point features include the node and the vertex. Specifically, a point is a stand-\\nalone feature, while a node is a topological junction representing a common X, Y coordinate pair \\nbetween intersecting lines and/or polygons. Vertices are defined as each bend along a line or polygon \\nfeature that is not the intersection of lines or polygons. \\nFigure 4.8 Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  87 \\nPoints can be spatially linked to form more complex features. Lines are one-dimensional features \\ncomposed of multiple, explicitly connected points. Lines are used to represent linear features such as \\nroads, streams, faults, boundaries, and so forth. Lines have the property of length. Lines that directly \\nconnect two nodes are sometimes referred to as chains, edges, segments, or arcs. \\nPolygons are two-dimensional features created by multiple lines that loop back to create a \u201cclosed\u201d \\nfeature. In the case of polygons, the first coordinate pair (point) on the first line segment is the same \\nas the last coordinate pair on the last line segment. Polygons are used to represent features such as \\ncity boundaries, geologic formations, lakes, soil associations, vegetation communities, and so forth. \\nPolygons have the properties of area and perimeter. Polygons are also called areas. \\nVector Data Models Structures \\nVector data models can be structured many different ways. We will examine two of the more common \\ndata structures here. The simplest vector data structure is called the spaghetti data model (Dangermond \\n1982). [2] In the spaghetti model, each point, line, and/or polygon feature is represented as a string of X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs (or as a single X, Y coordinate pair in the case of a vector image with a single point) with \\nno inherent structure (Figure 4.9 \"Spaghetti Data Model\"). One could envision each line in this model to \\nbe a single strand of spaghetti that is formed into complex shapes by the addition of more and more \\nstrands of spaghetti. It is notable that in this model, any polygons that lie adjacent to each other must be \\nmade up of their own lines, or stands of spaghetti. In other words, each polygon must be uniquely defined \\nby its own set of X, Y coordinate pairs, even if the adjacent polygons share the exact same boundary \\ninformation. This creates some redundancies within the data model and therefore reduces efficiency. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  88 \\nFigure 4.9 Spaghetti Data Model \\n \\nDespite the location designations associated with each line, or strand of spaghetti, spatial relationships \\nare not explicitly encoded within the spaghetti model; rather, they are  implied by their location. This \\nresults in a lack of topological information, which is problematic if the user attempts to make \\nmeasurements or analysis. The computational requirements, therefore, are very steep if any advanced \\nanalytical techniques are employed on vector files structured thusly. Nevertheless, the simple structure of \\nthe spaghetti data model allows for efficient reproduction of maps and graphics as this topological \\ninformation is unnecessary for plotting and printing. \\nIn contrast to the spaghetti data model, the topological data model is characterized by the inclusion of \\ntopological information within the dataset, as the name implies. Topology is a set of rules that model the \\nrelationships between neighboring points, lines, and polygons and determines how they share geometry. \\nFor example, consider two adjacent polygons. In the spaghetti model, the shared boundary of two \\nneighboring polygons is defined as two separate, identical lines. The inclusion of topology into the data \\nmodel allows for a single line to represent this shared boundary with an explicit reference to denote which \\nside of the line belongs with which polygon. Topology is also concerned with preserving spatial properties \\nwhen the forms are bent, stretched, or placed under similar geometric transformations, which allows for \\nmore efficient projection and reprojection of map files. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  89 \\nThree basic topological precepts that are necessary to understand the topological data model are outlined \\nhere. First, connectivity describes the arc-node topology for the feature dataset. As discussed previously, \\nnodes are more than simple points. In the topological data model, nodes are the intersection points where \\ntwo or more arcs meet. In the case of arc-node topology, arcs have both a from-node (i.e., starting node) \\nindicating where the arc begins and a to-node (i.e., ending node) indicating where the arc ends (Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\"). In addition, between each node pair is a line segment, sometimes called a \\nlink, which has its own identification number and references both its from-node and to-node. In Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\", arcs 1, 2, and 3 all intersect because they share node 11. Therefore, the \\ncomputer can determine that it is possible to move along arc 1 and turn onto arc 3, whi le it is not possible \\nto move from arc 1 to arc 5, as they do not share a common node. \\nFigure 4.10 Arc-Node Topology \\n \\nThe second basic topological precept is area definition. Area definition states that an arc that connects to \\nsurround an area defines a polygon, also called polygon-arc topology. In the case of polygon-arc topology, \\narcs are used to construct polygons, and each arc is stored only once (Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc \\nTopology\"). This results in a reduction in the amount of data stored and ensures  that adjacent polygon \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  90 \\nboundaries do not overlap. In the Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc Topology\", the polygon-arc topology makes it \\nclear that polygon F is made up of arcs 8, 9, and 10. \\nFigure 4.11 Polygon-Arc Topology \\n \\nContiguity, the third topological precept, is based on the concept that polygons that share a boundary are \\ndeemed adjacent. Specifically, polygon topology requires that all arcs in a polygon have a direction (a \\nfrom-node and a to-node), which allows adjacency information to be determined (Figure 4.12 \"Polygon \\nTopology\"). Polygons that share an arc are deemed adjacent, or contiguous, and therefore the \u201cleft\u201d and \\n\u201cright\u201d side of each arc can be defined. This left and right polygon information is stored explicitly within \\nthe attribute information of the topological data model. The \u201cuniverse polygon\u201d is an essential component \\nof polygon topology that represents the external area located outside of the study area.  Figure 4.12 \\n\"Polygon Topology\" shows that arc 6 is bound on the left by polygon B and to the right by polygon C. \\nPolygon A, the universe polygon, is to the left of arcs 1, 2, and 3.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  91 \\nFigure 4.12 Polygon Topology \\n \\nTopology allows the computer to rapidly determine and analyze the spatial relationships of all its included \\nfeatures. In addition, topological information is important because it allows for efficient error detection \\nwithin a vector dataset. In the case of polygon features, open or unclosed polygons, which occur when an \\narc does not completely loop back upon itself, and unlabeled polygons, which occur when an area does not \\ncontain any attribute information, violate polygon-arc topology rules. Another topological error found \\nwith polygon features is the sliver. Slivers occur when the shared boundary of two polygons do not meet \\nexactly (Figure 4.13 \"Common Topological Errors\"). \\nIn the case of line features, topological errors occur when two lines do not meet perfectly at a node. This \\nerror is called an \u201cundershoot\u201d when the lines do not extend far enough to meet each other and an \\n\u201covershoot\u201d when the line extends beyond the feature it should connect to (Figure 4.13 \"Common \\nTopological Errors\"). The result of overshoots and undershoots is a \u201cdangling node\u201d at the end of the line. \\nDangling nodes aren\u2019t always an error, however, as they occur in the case of dead-end streets on a road \\nmap. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  92 \\nFigure 4.13 Common Topological Errors \\n \\nMany types of spatial analysis require the degree of organization offered by topologically explicit data \\nmodels. In particular, network analysis (e.g., finding the best route from one location to another) and \\nmeasurement (e.g., finding the length of a river segment) relies heavily on the concept of to - and from-\\nnodes and uses this information, along with attribute information, to calculate distances, shortest rou tes, \\nquickest routes, and so forth. Topology also allows for sophisticated neighborhood analysis such as \\ndetermining adjacency, clustering, nearest neighbors, and so forth. \\nNow that the basics of the concepts of topology have been outlined, we can begin to  better understand the \\ntopological data model. In this model, the node acts as more than just a simple point along a line or \\npolygon. The node represents the point of intersection for two or more arcs. Arcs may or may not be \\nlooped into polygons. Regardless, all nodes, arcs, and polygons are individually numbered. This \\nnumbering allows for quick and easy reference within the data model.  \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Vector Model \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  93 \\nIn comparison with the raster data model, vector data models tend to be better representations of reality \\ndue to the accuracy and precision of points, lines, and polygons over the regularly spaced grid cells of the \\nraster model. This results in vector data tending to be more aesthetically pleasing than raster data. \\nVector data also provides an increased ability to alter the scale of observation and analysis. As each \\ncoordinate pair associated with a point, line, and polygon represents an infinitesimally exact location \\n(albeit limited by the number of significant digits and/or data acquisition methodologies), zooming deep \\ninto a vector image does not change the view of a vector graphic in the way that it does a raster graphic \\n(see Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nVector data tend to be more compact in data structure, so file sizes are typically much smaller than their \\nraster counterparts. Although the ability of modern computers has minimized the importance of \\nmaintaining small file sizes, vector data often require a fraction the computer storage space when \\ncompared to raster data. \\nThe final advantage of vector data is that topology is inherent in the vector model. This topological \\ninformation results in simplified spatial analysis (e.g., error detection, network analysis, proximity \\nanalysis, and spatial transformation) when using a vector model. \\nAlternatively, there are two primary disadvantages of the vector data model. First, the data structure \\ntends to be much more complex than the simple raster data model. As the location of each vertex must be \\nstored explicitly in the model, there are no shortcuts for storing data like there are for raster models (e.g., \\nthe run-length and quad-tree encoding methodologies). \\nSecond, the implementation of spatial analysis can also be relatively complicated due to minor differences \\nin accuracy and precision between the input datasets. Similarly, the algorithms for manipulating and \\nanalyzing vector data are complex and can lead to intensive processing  requirements, particularly when \\ndealing with large datasets. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector data utilizes points, lines, and polygons to represent the spatial features in a map.

The objective of this section is to understand how satellite imagery and aerial photography are \\nimplemented in GIS applications. \\nA wide variety of satellite imagery and aerial photography is available for use in geographic \\ninformation systems (GISs). Although these products are basically raster graphics, they are \\nsubstantively different in their usage within a GIS. Satellite imagery and aerial photography provide \\nimportant contextual information for a GIS and are often used to conduct heads-up digitizing \\n(Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1.4 \"Secondary Data Capture\") whereby \\nfeatures from the image are converted into vector datasets. \\nSatellite Imagery \\nRemotely sensed satellite imagery is becoming increasingly common as satellites equipped with \\ntechnologically advanced sensors are continually being sent into space by pu blic agencies and private \\ncompanies around the globe. Satellites are used for applications such as military and civilian earth \\nobservation, communication, navigation, weather, research, and more. Currently, more than 3,000 \\nsatellites have been sent to space, with over 2,500 of them originating from Russia and the United States. \\nThese satellites maintain different altitudes, inclinations, eccentricities, synchronies, and orbital centers, \\nallowing them to image a wide variety of surface features and processes  (Figure 4.14 \"Satellites Orbiting \\nthe Earth\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  96 \\nFigure 4.14 Satellites Orbiting the Earth \\n \\nSatellites can be active or passive. Active satellites make use of remote sensors that detect reflected \\nresponses from objects that are irradiated from artificially generated energy sources. For example, active \\nsensors such as radars emit radio waves, laser sensors emit light waves, and sonar sensors emit sound \\nwaves. In all cases, the sensor emits the signal and then calculates the time it takes for the returned signal \\nto \u201cbounce\u201d back from some remote feature. Knowing the speed of the emitted signal, the time delay from \\nthe original emission to the return can be used to calculate the distance to the feature.  \\nPassive satellites, alternatively, make use of sensors that detect the reflected or emitted electromagnetic \\nradiation from natural sources. This natural source is typically the energy from the sun, but other sources \\ncan be imaged as well, such as magnetism and geothermal activity. Using an example we\u2019ve all \\nexperienced, taking a picture with a flash-enabled camera would be active remote sensing, while using a \\ncamera without a flash (i.e., relying on ambient light to illuminate the scene) would be passive remote \\nsensing. \\nThe quality and quantity of satellite imagery is largely determined by their resolution. There are four types \\nof resolution that characterize any particular remote sensor (Campbell 2002).  [1] The spatial resolution of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  97 \\na satellite image, as described previously in the raster data model se ction (Section 4.1 \"Raster Data \\nModels\"), is a direct representation of the ground coverage for each pixel shown in the image. If a satellite \\nproduces imagery with a 10 m resolution, the corresponding ground coverage for each of those pixels is 10 \\nm by 10 m, or 100 square meters on the ground. Spatial resolution is determined by the sensors\u2019 \\ninstantaneous field of view (IFOV). The IFOV is essentially the ground area through which the sensor is \\nreceiving the electromagnetic radiation signal and is determined by height and angle of the imaging \\nplatform. \\nSpectral resolution denotes the ability of the sensor to resolve wavelength intervals, also called bands, \\nwithin the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral resolution is determined by the interval size of the \\nwavelengths and the number of intervals being scanned. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are \\nthose sensors that can resolve a multitude of wavelengths intervals within the spectrum. For example, the \\nIKONOS satellite resolves images for bands at the blue (445\u2013516 nm), green (506\u201395 nm), red (632\u201398 \\nnm), and near-infrared (757\u2013853 nm) wavelength intervals on its 4-meter multispectral sensor. \\nTemporal resolution is the amount of time between each image collection period and is determined by the \\nrepeat cycle of the satellite\u2019s orbit. Temporal resolution can be thought of as true-nadir or off-nadir. Areas \\nconsidered true-nadir are those located directly beneath the sensor while off-nadir areas are those that are \\nimaged obliquely. In the case of the IKONOS satellite, the temporal resolution is 3 to 5 days for off-nadir \\nimaging and 144 days for true-nadir imaging. \\nThe fourth and final type of resolution, radiometric resolution, refers to the sensitivity of the sensor to \\nvariations in brightness and specifically denotes the number of grayscale levels that can be imaged by the \\nsensor. Typically, the available radiometric values for a sensor are 8-bit (yielding values that range from \\n0\u2013255 as 256 unique values or as 28 values); 11-bit (0\u20132,047); 12-bit (0\u20134,095); or 16-bit (0\u201363,535) \\n(see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\",Section 5.1.1 \"Data Types\" for more on bits). Landsat-7, for \\nexample, maintains 8-bit resolution for its bands and can therefore record values for each pixel that range \\nfrom 0 to 255. \\nBecause of the technical constraints associated with satellite remote sensing systems, there is a trade -off \\nbetween these different types of resolution. Improving one type of resolution often necessitates a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  98 \\nreduction in one of the other types of resolution. For example, an increase in spatial resolution is typically \\nassociated with a decrease in spectral resolution, and vice versa. Similarly,  geostationary satellites (those \\nthat circle the earth proximal to the equator once each day) yield high temporal resolution but low spatial \\nresolution, while sun-synchronous satellites (those that synchronize a near-polar orbit of the sensor with \\nthe sun\u2019s illumination) yield low temporal resolution while providing high spatial resolution. Although \\ntechnological advances can generally improve the various resolutions of an image, care must always be \\ntaken to ensure that the imagery you have chosen is adequate to the represent or model the geospatial \\nfeatures that are most important to your study. \\nAerial Photography \\nAerial photography, like satellite imagery, represents a vast source of information for use in any GIS. \\nPlatforms for the hardware used to take aerial photographs include airplanes, helicopters, balloons, \\nrockets, and so forth. While aerial photography connotes images taken of the visible spectrum, sensors to \\nmeasure bands within the nonvisible spectrum (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared, near -infrared) can also be fixed \\nto aerial sources. Similarly, aerial photography can be active or passive and can be taken from vert ical or \\noblique angles. Care must be taken with aerial photographs as the sensors used to take the images are \\nsimilar to cameras in their use of lenses. These lenses add a curvature to the images, which becomes more \\npronounced as one moves away from the center of the photo (Figure 4.15 \"Curvature Error Due to \\nLenticular Properties of Camera\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  99 \\nFigure 4.15 Curvature Error Due to Lenticular Properties of Camera \\n \\nAnother source of potential error in an aerial photograph is relief displacement. This error arises from the \\nthree-dimensional aspect of terrain features and is seen as apparent leaning away of vertical objects from \\nthe center point of an aerial photograph. To imagine this type of error, consider that a smokestack would \\nlook like a doughnut if the viewing camera was directly above the feature. However, if this same \\nsmokestack was observed near the edge of the camera\u2019s view, one could observe the sides of the \\nsmokestack. This error is frequently seen with trees and multistory buildings and worsens w ith \\nincreasingly taller features. \\nOrthophotos are vertical photographs that have been geometrically \u201ccorrected\u201d to remove the curvature \\nand terrain-induced error from images (Figure 4.16 \"Orthophoto\"). The most common orthophoto \\nproduct is the digital ortho quarter quadrangle (DOQQ). DOQQs are available through the US Geological \\nSurvey (USGS), who began producing these images from their library of 1:40,000- scale National Aerial \\nPhotography Program photos. These images can be obtained in either grayscale or color with 1-meter \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  100 \\nspatial resolution and 8-bit radiometric resolution. As the name suggests, these images cover a quarter of \\na USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, which equals an approximately 25 square mile area. Included with these \\nphotos is an additional 50 to 300-meter edge around the photo that allows users to mosaic many DOQQs \\ninto a single, continuous image. These DOQQs are ideal for use in a GIS as background display \\ninformation, for data editing, and for heads-up digitizing. \\nFigure 4.16 Orthophoto \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  101 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery is a common tool for GIS mapping applications as this data becomes increasingly \\navailable due to ongoing technological advances. \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery can be passive or active. \\n\u2022 The four types of resolution associated with satellite imagery are spatial, spectral, temporal, and \\nradiometric. \\n\u2022 Vertical and oblique aerial photographs provide valuable baseline informati on for GIS applications. \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The variety of formats and data structures, as well as the disparate quality, \\nof geospatial data can result in a dizzying accumulation of useful and useless pieces of spatially \\nexplicit information that must be poked, prodded, and wrangled into a single, unified dataset. This \\nchapter addresses the basic concerns related to data acquisition and management of the various \\nformats and qualities of geospatial data currently available for use in modern geographic information \\nsystem (GIS) projects. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  103 \\n5.1 Geographic Data Acquisition \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to introduce different data types, measurement scales, and data capture \\nmethods. \\nAcquiring geographic data is an important factor in any geographic information system (GIS) effort. \\nIt has been estimated that data acquisition typically consumes 60 to 80 percent of the time and \\nmoney spent on any given project. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that GIS projects remain \\nmindful of their stated goals so the collection of spatial data proceeds in an efficient and effective \\nmanner as possible. This chapter outlines the many forms and sources of geospatial data available \\nfor use in a GIS. \\nData Types \\nThe type of data that we employ to help us understand a given entity is determined by (1) what we are \\nexamining, (2) what we want to know about that entity, and (3) our ability to measure that entity at a \\ndesired scale. The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, \\nnumbers, Boolean values, dates, and binaries. \\nAn alphanumeric string, or text, data type is any simple combination of letters and numbers that may or \\nmay not form coherent words. The number data type can be subcategorized as either floating-point or \\ninteger. A floating-point is any data value that contains decimal digits, while an integer is any data value \\nthat does not contain decimal digits. Integers can be short or long depending on the amount of significant \\ndigits in that number. Also, they are based on the concept of the \u201cbit\u201d in a computer. As you may recall, a \\nbit is the most basic unit of information in a computer and stores values in one of two states: 1 or 0. \\nTherefore, an 8-bit attribute would consist of eight 1s or 0s in any combination (e.g., 10010011, 00011011, \\n11100111). \\nShort integers are 16-bit values and therefore can be used to characterize numbers ranging either from \\n\u221232,768 to 32,767 or from 0 to 65,535 depending on whether the number is signed or unsigned (i.e., Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  104 \\ncontains a + or \u2212 sign).Long integers, alternatively, are 32-bit values and therefore can characterize \\nnumbers ranging either from \u22122,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or from 0 to 4,294,967,295.  \\nA single precision floating-point value occupies 32 bits, like the long integer. However, this data type \\nprovides for a value of up to 7 bits to the left of the decimal (a maxi mum value of 128, or 127 if signed) and \\nup to 23-bit values to the right of the decimal point (approximately 7 decimal digits). A \\ndouble precision floating-point value essentially stores two 32-bit values as a single value. Double \\nprecision floats, then, can represent a value with up to 11 bits to the left of the decimal point and values \\nwith up to 52 bits to the right of the decimal (approximately 16 decimal digits) ( Figure 5.1 \"Double \\nPrecision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer\"). \\nFigure 5.1 Double Precision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer \\n \\nBoolean, date, and binary values are less complex. Boolean values are simply those values that are deemed \\ntrue or false based on the application of a Boolean operator such  as AND, OR, and NOT. The date data \\ntype is presumably self-explanatory, while the binary data type represents attributes whose values are \\neither 1 or 0. \\nMeasurement Scale \\nIn addition to defining data by type, a measurement scale acts to group data accordi ng to level of \\ncomplexity (Stevens 1946). [1] For the purposes of GIS analyses, measurement scales can be grouped in to \\ntwo general categories. Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data; interval and ratio data \\nrepresent numeric data. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  105 \\nThe most simple data measurement scale is the nominal, or named, scale. The nominal scale makes \\nstatements about what to call data points but does not allow for scalar comparisons between one object \\nand another. For example, the attribution of nominal information to a set of points that represent cities \\nwill describe whether the given locale is \u201cLos Angeles\u201d or \u201cNew York.\u201d However, no further denotations, \\nsuch as population or voting history, can be made about those locales. Other examples of nominal data \\ninclude last name, eye color, land-use type, ethnicity, and gender. \\nOrdinal data places attribute information into ranks and therefore yields more precisely scaled \\ninformation than nominal data. Ordinal data describes the position in which data occur, such as first,  \\nsecond, third, and so forth. These scales may also take on names, such as \u201cvery unsatisfied,\u201d \u201cunsatisfied,\u201d \\n\u201csatisfied,\u201d and \u201cvery satisfied.\u201d Although this measurement scale indicates the ranking of each data point \\nrelative to other data points, the ordinal scale does not explicitly denote the exact quantitative difference \\nbetween these rankings. For example, if an ordinal attribute represents which runner came in first, \\nsecond, or third place, it does not state by how much time the winning runner beat the second place \\nrunner. Therefore, one cannot undertake arithmetic operations with ordinal data. Only sequence is \\nexplicit. \\nA measurement scale that does allow precise quantitative statements to be made about attributes \\nis interval data. Interval data are measured along a scale in which each position is equidistant to one \\nanother. Elevation and temperature readings are common representations of interval data. For example, \\nit can be determined through this scale that 30 \u00baF is 5 \u00baF warmer than 25 \u00baF. A notabl e property of the \\ninterval scale is that zero is not a meaningful value in the sense that zero does not represent nothingness, \\nor the absence of a value. Indeed, 0 \u00baF does not indicate that no temperature exists. Similarly, an \\nelevation of 0 feet does not indicate a lack of elevation; rather, it indicates mean sea level.  \\nRatio data are similar to the interval measurement scale; however, it is based around a meaningful zero \\nvalue. Population density is an example of ratio data whereby a 0 population density indicates that no \\npeople live in the area of interest. Similarly, the Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale as 0 K does imply \\nthat no heat (temperature) is measurable within the given attribute.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  106 \\nSpecific to numeric datasets, data values also can be considered to be discrete or \\ncontinuous. Discrete data are those that maintain a finite number of possible values, \\nwhile continuous data can be represented by an infinite number of values. For example, the number of \\nmature trees on a small property will necessarily be between one and one hundred (for argument\u2019s sake). \\nHowever, the height of those trees represents a continuous data value as there are an infinite number of \\npotential values (e.g., one tree may be 20 feet tall, 20.1 feet, or 20.15 feet, 20.157 fee t, and so forth). \\nPrimary Data Capture \\nNow that we have a sense of the different data types and measurement scales available for use in a GIS, we \\nmust direct our thoughts to how this data can be acquired. Primary data capture is a direct data \\nacquisition methodology that is usually associated with some type of in -the-field effort. In the case of \\nvector data, directly captured data commonly comes from a global positioning system (GPS) or other \\ntypes of surveying equipment such as a total station (Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station \\n(right)\"). Total stations are specialized, primary data capture instruments that combine a theodolite (or \\ntransit), which measures horizontal and vertical angles, with a tool to measure the slope distance from the \\nunit to an observed point. Use of a total station allows field crews to quickly and accurately derive the \\ntopography for a particular landscape. \\nFigure 5.2 GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right) \\n \\nIn the case of GPS, handheld units access positional data from satellites and log the information for \\nsubsequent retrieval. A network of twenty-four navigation satellites is situated around the globe and \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  107 \\nprovides precise coordinate information for any point on the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 5.3 \"Earth Imaging \\nSatellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Maintaining a line of sight to four or more of these satellites provides \\nthe user with reasonably accurate location information. These locations can be collected as individual \\npoints or can be linked together to form lines or polygons depending on user preference. Attribute data \\nsuch as land-use type, telephone pole number, and river name can be simultaneously entered by the user. \\nThis location and attribute data can then be uploaded to the GIS for visualization. Depending on the G PS \\nmake and model, this upload often requires some type of intermediate file conversion via software \\nprovided by the manufacturer of the GPS unit. However, there are some free online resources that can \\nconvert GPS data from one format to another. GPSBabel is an example of such an online resource \\n(http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/gpsbabel). \\nIn addition to the typical GPS unit shown in Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right)\", GPS is \\nbecoming increasingly incorporated into other new technologies. For example, smartphones now embed \\nGPS capabilities as a standard technological component. These phone/GPS units maintain comparable \\naccuracy to similarly priced stand-alone GPS units and are largely responsible for a renaissance in \\nfacilitating portable, real-time data capture and sharing to the masses. The ubiquity of this technology led \\nto a proliferation of crowdsourced data acquisition alternatives. Crowdsourcing is a data collection \\nmethod whereby users contribute freely to building spatial databases. This rapidly expanding \\nmethodology is utilized in such applications as TomTom\u2019s MapShare application, Google Earth, Bing \\nMaps, and ArcGIS. \\nRaster data obtained via direct capture comes more commonly from remotely sensed sources ( Figure 5.3 \\n\"Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Remotely sensed data offers the advantage of \\nobviating the need for physical access to the area being imaged. In addition, huge tracts of land can be \\ncharacterized with little to no additional time and labor by the researcher. On the other hand, validation is \\nrequired for remotely sensed data to ensure that the sensor is not only operating correctly but properly \\ncalibrated to collect the desired information. Satellites and aerial cameras provide the most ubiquitous \\nsources of direct-capture raster data (Chapter 4 \"Data Models for GIS\", Section 4.3.1 \"Satellite Imagery\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  108 \\nFigure 5.3 Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data \\n \\nSecondary Data Capture \\nSecondary data capture is an indirect methodology that utilizes the vast amount of existing geospatial data \\navailable in both digital and hard-copy formats. Prior to initiating any GIS effort, it is always wise to mine \\nonline resources for existing GIS data that may fulfill your mapping needs without the potentially \\nintensive step of creating the data from scratch. Such digital GIS data are available from a variety of \\nsources including international agencies (CGIAR, CIESIN, United Nations, World Bank, etc.) ; federal \\ngovernments (USGS, USDA, NOAA, USFWS, NASA, EPA, US Census, etc.); state governments (CDFG, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  109 \\nTeale Data Center, INGIS, MARIS, NH GIS Resources, etc.); local governments (SANDAG, RCLIS, etc.); \\nuniversity websites (UCLA, Duke, Stanford, University of Chicago, Indiana Spatial Data Portal, etc.); and \\ncommercial websites (ESRI, GeoEye, Geocomm, etc.). These secondary data are available in a wide \\nassortment of file types, extents, and sizes but is ready-made to be used in most GIS software packages. \\nOften these data are free, but many sites will charge a fee for access to the proprietary information they \\nhave developed. \\nAlthough these data sources are all cases where the information has been converted to digital format and \\nproperly projected for use in a GIS, there is also a great deal of spatial information that can be gleaned \\nfrom existing, nondigital sources. Paper maps, for example, may contain current or historic information \\non a locale that cannot be found in digital format. In this case, the process  of digitization can be used to \\ncreate digital files from the original paper copy. Three primary methods exist for digitizing spatial \\ninformation: two are manual, and one is automated. \\nTablet digitizing is a manual data capture method whereby a user enters coordinate information into a \\ncomputer through the use of a digitizing tablet and a digitizing puck. To begin, a paper map is secured to a \\nback-lit digitizing tablet. The backlight allows all features on the map to be easily observed, which reduces \\neyestrain. The coordinates of the point, line, and/or polygon features on the paper map are then entered \\ninto a digital file as the user employs a puck, which is similar to a multibutton mouse with a crosshair, to \\n\u201cclick\u201d their way around the vertices of each desired feature. The resulting digital file will need to be \\nproperly georeferenced following completion of the digitization task to ensure that this information will \\nproperly align with existing datasets. \\nHeads-up digitizing, the second manual data capture method, is referred to as \u201con-screen\u201d digitizing. \\nHeads-up digitizing can be used on either paper maps or existing digital files. In the case of a paper map, \\nthe map must first be scanned into the computer at a high enough resolution that will allow all per tinent \\nfeatures to be resolved. Second, the now-digital image must be registered so the map will conform to an \\nexisting coordinate system. To do this, the user can enter control points on the screen and transform, or \\n\u201crubber-sheet,\u201d the scanned image into real world coordinates. Finally, the user simply zooms to specific \\nareas on the map and traces the points, lines, and/or polygons, similar to the tablet digitization example. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  110 \\nHeads-up digitizing is particularly simple when existing GIS files, satellite ima ges, or aerial photographs \\nare used as a baseline. For example, if a user plans to digitize the boundary of a lake as seen from a \\ngeoreferenced satellite image, the steps of scanning and registering can be skipped, and projection \\ninformation from the originating image can simply be copied over to the digitized file. \\nThe third, automated method of secondary data capture requires the user to scan a paper map and \\nvectorize the information therein. This vectorization method typically requires a specific software package \\nthat can convert a raster scan to vector lines. This requires a very high-resolution, clean scan. If the image \\nis not clean, all the imperfections on the map will likely be converted to false points/lines/polygons in the \\ndigital version. If a clean scan is not available, it is often faster to use a manual digitization methodology. \\nRegardless, this method is much quicker than the aforementioned manual methods and may be the best \\noption if multiple maps must be digitized and/or if time is a limiting factor. Often, a semiautomatic \\napproach is employed whereby a map is scanned and vectorized, followed by a heads- up digitizing session \\nto edit and repair any errors that occurred during automation. \\nThe final secondary data capture method worth noting is the use of information from  reports and \\ndocuments. Via this method, one enters information from reports and documents into the attribute \\ntable of an existing, digital GIS file that contains all the pertinent points, lines, and polygons. For example, \\nnew information specific to census tracts may become available following a scientific study. The GIS user \\nsimply needs to download the existing GIS file of census tracts and begin entering the study\u2019s \\nreport/document information directly into the attribute table. If the data tables are available digitally, the \\nuse of the \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201crelate\u201d functions in a GIS (Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\") are often extremely \\nhelpful as they will automate much of the data entry effort. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, numbers, Boolean \\nvalues, dates, and binaries. \\n\u2022 Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data, while interval and ratio data represent numeric \\ndata. \\n\u2022 Data capture methodologies are derived from either primary or secondary sources. \\n Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  111 \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand the basic properties of a relational database management \\nsystem. \\nA database is a structured collection of data files. A database management system (DBMS) is a software \\npackage that allows for the creation, storage, maintenance, manipulation, and retrieval of large \\ndatasets that are distributed over one or more files. A DBMS and its associated functions are usually \\naccessed through commercial software packages such as Microsoft Access, Oracle, FileMaker Pro, or \\nAvanquest MyDataBase. Database management normally refers to the management of tabular data \\nin row and column format and is frequently used for personal, business, government, and scientific \\nendeavors. Geospatial database management systems, alternatively, include the functionality of a \\nDBMS but also contain specific geographic information about each data point such as identity, \\nlocation, shape, and orientation. Integrating this geographic information with the tabular attribute \\ndata of a classical DBMS provide users with powerful tools to visualize and answer the spatially \\nexplicit questions that arise in an increasingly technological society. \\nSeveral types of database models exist, such as the flat, hierarchical, network, and relational models \\n(Worboys 1995; Jackson 1999). [1], [2] A flat database is essentially a spreadsheet whereby all data are \\nstored in a single, large table (Figure 5.4 \"Flat Database\"). A hierarchical database is also a fairly \\nsimple model that organizes data into a \u201cone-to-many\u201d association across levels (Figure 5.5 \\n\"Hierarchical Database\"). Common examples of this model include phylogenetic trees for \\nclassification of plants and animals and familial genealogical trees showing parent-child \\nrelationships. Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases, however, because they also \\nsupport \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationships (Figure 5.6 \"Network Database\"). This expanded capability \\nallows greater search flexibility within the dataset and reduces potential redundancy of information. \\nAlternatively, both the hierarchical and network models can become incredibly complex depending \\non the size of the databases and the number of interactions between the data points. Modern Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  113 \\ngeographic information system (GIS) software typically employs a fourth model referred to as \\na relational database (Codd 1970). [3] \\nFigure 5.4 Flat Database \\n \\nFigure 5.5 Hierarchical Database \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  114 \\nFigure 5.6 Network Database \\n \\nRelational Database Management Systems \\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of tables that are connected in such a \\nway that that data can be accessed without reorganization of the tables. The tables are created such that \\neach column represents a particular attribute (e.g., soil type, PIN number, last name, acreage) and each \\nrow contains a unique instance of data for that columnar attribute (e.g., Delhi Sands Soils, 5555, Smith, \\n412.3 acres) \\nIn the relational model, each table (not surprisingly called a relation) is linked to each other table via \\npredetermined keys (Date 1995). [4] The primary key represents the attribute (column) whose value \\nuniquely identifies a particular record (row) in the relation (table). The primary key may not contain \\nmissing values as multiple missing values would represent nonunique entities that violate the basic rule of \\nthe primary key. The primary key corresponds to an identical attribute in a secondary table (and possibly \\nthird, fourth, fifth, etc.) called a foreign key. This results in all the information in the first table being \\ndirectly related to the information in the second table via the primary and foreign keys, hence the term \\n\u201crelational\u201d DBMS. With these links in place, tables within the database can be kept very simple, resulting \\nin minimal computation time and file complexity. This process can be repeated over many tables as long \\nas each contains a foreign key that corresponds to another table\u2019s primary key. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  115 \\nThe relational model has two primary advantages over the other database models described earlier. First, \\neach table can now be separately prepared, maintained, and edited. This is particularly useful when one \\nconsiders the potentially huge size of many of today\u2019s modern databases. Second, the tables may be \\nmaintained separately until the need for a particular query or analysis calls for the tables to be related. \\nThis creates a large degree of efficiency for processing of information within a given database.  \\nIt may become apparent to the reader that there is great potential for redundancy in this model as each \\ntable must contain an attribute that corresponds to an attribute in every other related table. Therefore, \\nredundancy must actively be monitored and managed in a RDBMS. To accomplish this, a set of rules \\ncalled normal forms have been developed (Codd 1970). [5] There are three basic normal forms. \\nThe first normal form (Figure 5.7 \"First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below)\") refers to five \\nconditions that must be met (Date 1995). [6] They are as follows: \\n1. There is no sequence to the ordering of the rows. \\n2. There is no sequence to the ordering of the columns. \\n3. Each row is unique. \\n4. Every cell contains one and only one value. \\n5. All values in a column pertain to the same subject. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  116 \\nFigure 5.7 First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe second normal form states that any column that is not a primary key must be dependent on the \\nprimary key. This reduces redundancy by eliminating the potential for mult iple primary keys throughout \\nmultiple tables. This step often involves the creation of new tables to maintain normalization.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  117 \\nFigure 5.8 Second Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe third normal form states that all nonprimary keys must depend on the primary key, while the primary \\nkey remains independent of all nonprimary keys. This form was wittily summed up by Kent (1983)  [7] who \\nquipped that all nonprimary keys \u201cmust provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the \\nkey.\u201d Echoing this quote is the rejoinder: \u201cso help me Codd\u201d (personal communication with Foresman \\n1989). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  118 \\nFigure 5.9 Third Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nJoins and Relates \\nAn additional advantage of an RDBMS is that it allows attribute data in separate tables to be linked in a \\npost hoc fashion. The two operations commonly used to accomplish this are the join and relate. \\nThe join operation appends the fields of one table into a second table through the use of an attribute or \\nfield that is common to both tables. This is commonly utilized to combine attribute information from one \\nor more nonspatial data tables (i.e., information taken from reports or documents) with a spatially explicit \\nGIS feature layer. A second type of join combines feature information based on spatial location and \\nassociation rather than on common attributes. In ArcGIS, three types of spatial joins are available. Users \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  119 \\nmay (1) match each feature to the closest feature, (2) match each feature to the feature that it is part of, or \\n(3) match each feature to the feature that it intersects. \\nAlternatively, the relate operation temporarily associates two map layers or tables while keeping them \\nphysically separate. Relates are bidirectional, so data can be accessed from the one of the tables by \\nselecting records in the other table. The relate operation also allows for the association of three or more \\ntables, if necessary. \\nSometimes it can be unclear as to which operation one should use. As a general rule, joins are most \\nsuitable for instances involving one-to-one or many-to-one relationships. Joins are also advantageous due \\nto the fact that the data from the two tables are readily observable in the single output table . The use of \\nrelates, on the other hand, are suitable for all table relationships (one -to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, \\nand many-to-many); however, they can slow down computer access time if the tables are particularly \\nlarge or spread out over remote locations. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Database management systems can be flat, hierarchical, network, or relational.  \\n\u2022 Relational database management systems (RDBMS) utilize primary keys and foreign keys to link data \\ntables. \\n\u2022 The RDBMS model reduces data redundancy by employing three basic \u201cnormal forms.\u201d  \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to overview a sample of the most common types of vector, raster, and \\nhybrid file formats. \\nGeospatial data are stored in many different file formats. Each geographic information system (GIS) \\nsoftware package, and each version of these software packages, supports different formats. This is \\ntrue for both vector and raster data. Although several of the more common file formats are \\nsummarized here, many other formats exist for use in various GIS programs. \\nVector File Formats \\nThe most common vector file format is the shapefile. Shapefiles, developed by ESRI in the early 1990s for \\nuse with the dBASE III database management software package in ArcView 2, are simple, nontopological \\nfiles developed to store the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. \\nShapefiles are incapable of storing null values, as well as annotations or network features. Field names \\nwithin the attribute table are limited to ten characters, and each shapefile can represent only point, line, \\nor polygon feature sets. Supported data types are limited to floating point, integer, date, and text. \\nShapefiles are supported by almost all commercial and open-source GIS software. \\nDespite being called a \u201cshapefile,\u201d this format is actually a compilation of many different files. Table 5.1 \\n\"Shapefile File Types\" lists and describes the different file formats associated with the shapefile. Among \\nthose listed, only the SHP, SHX, and DBF file formats are mandatory to create a functioning shapefile, \\nwhile all others are conditionally required. As a general rule, the names for each file should conform to the \\nMS-DOS 8.3 convention when using older versions of GIS software packages. According to this \\nconvention, the filename prefix can contain up to eight characters, and the filename suffix contains three \\ncharacters. The more recent GIS software packages have relaxed this requirement and will accept longer \\nfilename prefixes. \\nTable 5.1 Shapefile File Types Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  122 \\nFile Extension Purpose \\nSHP* Feature geometry \\nSHX* Index format for the feature geometry \\nDBF* Feature attribute information in dBASE IV format \\nPRJ Projection information \\nSBN and SBX Spatial index of the features \\nFBN and FBX Read-only spatial index of the features \\nAIN and AIH Attribute information for active fields in the table \\nIXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles \\nMXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles with ODB format \\nATX Attribute index used in ArcGIS 8 and later \\nSHP.XML Metadata in XML format \\nCPG Code page specifications for identifying character encoding \\n* Indicates mandatory files \\nThe earliest vector format file for use in GIS software packages, which is still in use today, is the \\nArcInfo coverage. This georelational file format supports multiple features types (e.g., points, lines, \\npolygons, annotations) while also storing the topological information associated with those features. \\nAttribute data are stored as multiple files in a separate directory labeled \u201cInfo.\u201d Due to its creation in an \\nMS-DOS environment, these files maintain strict naming conventions. File names cannot be longer than \\nthirteen characters, cannot contain spaces, cannot start with a number, and must be completely in \\nlowercase. Coverages cannot be edited in ArcGIS 9.x or later versions of ESRI\u2019s software package. \\nThe US Census Bureau maintains a specific type of shapefile referred to as TIGER \\norTIGER/Line (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system). Although these \\nopen-source files do not contain actual census information, they map features such as census tracts, \\nroads, railroads, buildings, rivers, and other features that support and improve the bureau and improve \\nthe Bureau\u2019s ability to#8217;s ability to collect census information. TIGER/Line shapefiles, first released \\nin 1990, are topologically explicit and are linked to the Census Bureau\u2019s Master Address File (MAF), Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  123 \\ntherefore enabling the geocoding of street addresses. These files are free to the public and can be freely \\ndownloaded from private vendors that support the format. \\nTheAutoCAD DXF (Drawing Interchange Format or Drawing Exchange Format)is a proprietary vector file \\nformat developed by Autodesk to allow interchange between engineering -based CAD (computer-aided \\ndesign) software and other mapping software packages. DXF files were originally released in 1982 with \\nthe purpose of providing an exact representation of AutoCAD\u2019s native DWG format. Although the DXF is \\nstill commonly used, newer versions of AutoCAD have incorporated more complex data types (e.g., \\nregions, dynamic blocks) that are not supported in the DXF format. Therefore, it may be presumed that \\nthe DXF format may become less popular in geospatial analysis over time.  \\nFinally, the US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains an open-source vector file format that details \\nphysical and cultural features across the United States. These topologically \\nexplicit DLGs (Digital Line Graphics) come in large-, intermediate-, and small-scale depending on \\nwhether they are derived from 1:24,000-; 1:100,000-; or 1:2,000,000-scale USGS topographic \\nquadrangle maps. The features available in the different DLG types depend on the scale of the DLG but \\ngenerally include data such as administrative and political boundaries, hydrography, transportation \\nsystems, hypsography, and land cover. \\nVector data files can also be structured to represent surface elevation information. \\nA TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) is an open-source vector data structure that uses contiguous, \\nnonoverlapping triangles to represent geographic surfaces (Figure 5.10 \"Triangulated Irregular Network \\n(TIN)\"). Whereas the raster depiction of a surface represents elevation as an average value over the spatial \\nextent of the individual pixel (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster File Formats\"), the TIN data structure models \\neach vertex of the triangle as an exact elevation value at a specific po int on the earth. The arcs between \\neach vertex are an approximation of the elevation between two vertices. These arcs are then aggregated \\ninto triangles from which information on elevation, slope, aspect, and surface area can be derived across \\nthe entire extent of the model\u2019s space. Note that term \u201cirregular\u201d in the name of the data model refers to \\nthe fact that the vertices are typically laid out in a scattered fashion.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  124 \\nFigure 5.10 Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) \\n \\nThe use of TINs confers certain advantages over raster-based elevation models (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster \\nFile Formats\"). First, linear topographic features are very accurately represented relative to their raster \\ncounterpart. Second, a comparatively small number of data points are needed  to represent a surface, so \\nfile sizes are typically much smaller. This is particularly true as vertices can be clustered in areas where \\nrelief is complex and can be sparse in areas where relief is simple. Third, specific elevation data can be \\nincorporated into the data model in a post hoc fashion via the placement of additional vertices if the \\noriginal is deemed insufficient or inadequate. Finally, certain spatial statistics can be calculated that \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  125 \\ncannot be obtained when using a raster-based elevation model, such as flood plain delineation, storage \\ncapacity curves for reservoirs, and time-area curves for hydrographs. \\nRaster File Formats \\nA multitude of raster file format types are available for use in GIS. The selection of raster formats has \\ndramatically increased with the widespread availability of imagery from digital cameras, video recorders, \\nsatellites, and so forth. Raster imagery is typically 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit (16 million colors). Due to \\nongoing technological advancements, raster image file sizes have been getting larger and larger. To deal \\nwith this potential constraint, two types of file compression are commonly used: lossless and \\nlossy. Lossless compression reduces file size without decreasing image quality.  Lossy compression \\nattempts to exploit limitations of the human eye by removing information from the image that cannot be \\nsensed. As you may guess, lossy compression results in smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  \\nAmong the most common raster files used on the web are the JPEG, T IFF, and PNG formats, all of which \\nare open source and can be used with most GIS software packages. \\nThe JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) andTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) raster formats are \\nmost frequently used by digital cameras to store 8-bit values for each of the red, blue, and green colors \\nspaces (and sometimes 16-bit colors, in the case of TIFF images). JPEGs support lossy compression, while \\nTIFFs can be either lossy or lossless. Unlike JPEG, TIFF images can be saved in either RGB or CMYK \\ncolor spaces.PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are 24-bit images that support either lossy or lossless \\ncompression. PNG files are designed for efficient viewing in web-based browsers such as Internet \\nExplorer, Mozilla Firefox, Netscape, and Safari. \\nNative JPEG, TIFF, and PNG files do not have georeferenced information associated with them and \\ntherefore cannot be used in any geospatial mapping efforts. In order to employ these files in a GIS, \\na world file must first be created. A world file is a separate, plaintext data file that specifies the locations \\nand transformations that allow the image to be projected into a standard coordinate system (e.g., \\nUniversal Transverse Mercator [UTM] or State Plane). The filename of the world file is based on the name \\nof the raster file, while a w is typically added into to the file extension. The world file extension name for a \\nJPEG is JPW; for a TIFF, it is TFW; and for a PNG, PGW. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  126 \\nAn example of a raster file format with explicit georeferencing information is the \\nproprietary MrSID (Multiresolution Seamless Image Database) format. This lossless compression format \\nwas developed by LizardTech, Inc., for use with large aerial photographs or satellite images, whereby \\nportions of a compressed image can be viewed quickly without having to decompress the entire file. The \\nMrSID format is frequently used for visualizing orthophotos. \\nLike MrSID, the proprietary ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) format also includes georeferencing \\ninformation within the file structure. This lossy compression format was developed by Earth Resource \\nMapping and supports up to 255 layers of image information. Due to the potentially huge file sizes \\nassociated with an image that supports so many layers, ECW files represent an excellent option for \\nperforming rapid analysis on large images while using a relatively small amount of the computer\u2019s RAM \\n(Random Access Memory), thus accelerating computation speed. \\nLike the open-source, vector-based DLG, DRGs (Digital Raster Graphics)are scanned versions of USGS \\ntopographic maps and include all of the collar material from the originals. The geospatial information \\nfound within the image\u2019s neatline is georeferenced, specifically to the UTM coordinate system. These \\ngraphics are scanned at a minimum of 250 dpi (dots per inch) and therefore have a spatial resolution of \\napproximately 2.4 meters. DRGs contain up to thirteen colors and therefore may look slightly different \\nfrom the originals. In addition, they include all the collar material from the original print vers ion, are \\ngeoreferenced to the surface of the earth, fit the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, and are \\nmost likely based on the NAD27 data points (NAD stands for North American Datum).  \\nLike the TIN vector format, some raster file formats are developed explicitly for modeling elevation. These \\ninclude the USGS DEM, USGS SDTS, and DTED file formats.  \\nTheUSGS DEM (US Geological Survey Digital Elevation Model) is a popular file format due to widespread \\navailability, the simplicity of the model, and the extensive software support for the format. Each pixel \\nvalue in these grid-based DEMs denotes spot elevations on the ground, usually in feet or meters. Care \\nmust be taken when using grid-based DEMs due to the enormous volume of data that accompanies the se \\nfiles as the spatial extent covered in the image begins to increase. DEMs are referred to \\nas digital terrain models (DTMs) when they represent a simple, bare-earth model and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  127 \\nas digital surface models (DSMs)when they include the heights of landscape features such as buildings \\nand trees (Figure 5.11 \"Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right)\" ). \\nFigure 5.11 Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right) \\n \\nUSGS DEMs can be classified into one of four levels of quality (labeled 1 to 4) depending on its source \\ndata and resolution. This source data can be 1:24,000-; 1:63,360-; or 1:250,000-scale topographic \\nquadrangles. The DEM format is a single file of ASCII text comprised of three data blocks; A, B, and C. \\nThe A block contains header information such as data origin, type, and measurement systems. The B \\nblock contains contiguous elevation data described as a six-character integer. The C block contains trailer \\ninformation such as root-mean square (RMS) error of the scene. The USGS DEM format has recently been \\nsucceeded by the USGS SDTS (Spatial Data Transfer Standard) DEMformat. The SDTS format [1] was \\nspecifically developed as a distribution format for transferring data from one computer to another with \\nzero data loss. \\nThe DTED (Digital Terrain Elevation Data) format is another elevation specific raster file format. It was \\ndeveloped in the 1970s for military purposes such as line of sight analysis, 3- D visualization, and mission \\nplanning. The DTED format maintains three levels of data over five different latitudinal zones. Level 0 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  128 \\ndata has a resolution of approximately 900 meters; Level 1 data has a resolution of approximately 90 \\nmeters; and Level 2 data has a resolution of approximately 30 meters.  \\nHybrid File Formats \\nA geodatabase is a recently developed, proprietary ESRI file format that supports both vector and raster \\nfeature datasets (e.g., points, lines, polygons, annotation, JPEG, TIFF) within a single file.  This format \\nmaintains topological relationships and is stored as an MDB file. The geodatabase was developed to be a \\ncomprehensive model for representing and modeling geospatial information.  \\nThere are three different types of geodatabases. The personal geodatabase was developed for single-user \\nediting, whereby two editors cannot work on the same geodatabase at a given time. The personal \\ngeodatabase employs the Microsoft Access DBMS file format and maintains a size limit of 2 gigabytes per \\nfile, although it has been noted that performance begins to degrade after file size approaches 250 \\nmegabytes. The personal geodatabase is currently being phased out by ESRI and is therefore not used for \\nnew data creation. \\nThe file geodatabase similarly allows only single-user editing, but this restriction applies only to unique \\nfeature datasets within a geodatabase. The file geodatabase incorporates new tools such as domains (rules \\napplied to attributes), subtypes (groups of objects with a feature class or table), and split/ merge policies \\n(rules to control and define the output of split and merge operations). This format stores information as \\nbinary files with a size limit of 1 terabyte and has been noted to perform and scale much more efficiently \\nthan the personal geodatabase (approximately one-third of the feature geometry storage required by \\nshapefiles and personal geodatabases). File databases are not tied to any specific relational database \\nmanagement system and can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. Finally,  file \\ngeodatabases can be compressed to read-only formats that further reduce file size without subsequently \\nreducing performance. \\nThe third hybrid ESRI format is the ArcSDE geodatabase, which allows multiple editors to simultaneously \\nwork on feature datasets within a single geodatabase (a.k.a. versioning). Like the file geodatabase, this \\nformat can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. File size is limited to 4 gigabytes and its Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  129 \\nproprietary nature requires an ArcInfo or ArcEditor license for use. The ArcSDE geodatabase is \\nimplemented on the SQL Server Express software package, which is a free DBMS platform developed by \\nMicrosoft. \\nIn addition to the geodatabase, Adobe Systems Incorporated\u2019s \\ngeospatial PDF (Portable Document Format) is an open-source format that allows for the representation \\nof geometric entities such as points, lines, and polygons. Geospatial PDFs can be used to find and mark \\ncoordinate pairs, measure distances, reproject files, and georegister raster images. This format is \\nparticularly useful as the PDF is widely accepted to be the preferred standard for printable web \\ndocuments. Although functionally similar, the geospatial PDF should not be confused with the GeoPDF \\nformat developed by TerraGo Technologies. Rather, the GeoPDF is a b randed version of the geospatial \\nPDF. \\nFinally, Google Earth supports a new, open-source, hybrid file format referred to as \\na KML (Keyhole Markup Language). KML files associate points, lines, polygons, images, 3-D models, and \\nso forth, with a longitude and latitude value, as well as other view information such as tilt, heading, \\naltitude, and so forth. KMZ files are commonly encountered, and they are zipped versions KML files.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Common vector file formats used in geospatial applications include shapefiles, coverages, TIGER/Lines, \\nAutoCAD DXFs, and DLGs. \\n\u2022 Common raster file formats used in geospatial applications include JPGs, TIFFs, PNGs, MrSIDs, ECWs, \\nDRGs, USGS DEMs, and DTEDs. \\n\u2022 Common hybrid file formats used in geospatial applications include geodatabases (personal, file, and \\nArcSDE) and geospatial PDFs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to ascertain the different types of error inherent in geospatial datasets.  \\nNot all geospatial data are created equally. Data quality refers to the ability of a given dataset to \\nsatisfy the objective for which it was created. With the voluminous amounts of geospatial data being \\ncreated and served to the cartographic community, care must be taken by individual geographic \\ninformation system (GIS) users to ensure that the data employed for their project is suitable for the \\ntask at hand. \\nTwo primary attributes characterize data quality. Accuracy describes how close a measurement is to \\nits actual value and is often expressed as a probability (e.g., 80 percent of all points are within +/\u2212 5 \\nmeters of their true locations). Precision refers to the variance of a value when repeated \\nmeasurements are taken. A watch may be correct to 1/1000th of a second (precise) but may be 30 \\nminutes slow (not accurate). As you can see in Figure 5.12 \"Accuracy and Precision\", the blue darts \\nare both precise and accurate, while the red darts are precise but inaccurate. \\nFigure 5.12 Accuracy and Precision \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  131 \\nSeveral types of error can arise when accuracy and/or precision requirements are not met during \\ndata capture and creation. Positional accuracy is the probability of a feature being within +/\u2212 units of \\neither its true location on earth (absolute positional accuracy) or its location in relation to other \\nmapped features (relative positional accuracy). For example, it could be said that a particular \\nmapping effort may result in 95 percent of trees being mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet for their true \\nlocation (absolute), or 95 percent of trees are mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet of their location as \\nobserved on a digital ortho quarter quadrangle (relative). \\nSpeaking about absolute positional error does beg the question, however, of what exactly is the true \\nlocation of an object? As discussed in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", differing conceptions of the earth\u2019s \\nshape has led to a plethora of projections, data points, and spheroids, each attempting to clarify \\npositional errors for particular locations on the earth. To begin addressing this unanswerable \\nquestion, the US National Map Accuracy Standard (or NMAS) suggests that to meet horizontal \\naccuracy requirements, a paper map is expected to have no more than 10 percent of measurable \\npoints fall outside the accuracy values range shown in Figure 5.13 \"Relation between Positional Error \\nand Scale\". Similarly, the vertical accuracy of no more than 10 percent of elevations on a contour \\nmap shall be in error of more than one-half the contour interval. Any map that does not meet these \\nhorizontal and vertical accuracy standards will be deemed unacceptable for publication. \\nFigure 5.13 Relation between Positional Error and Scale \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  132 \\nPositional errors arise via multiple sources. The process of digitizing paper maps commonly \\nintroduces such inaccuracies. Errors can arise while registering the map on the digitizing board. A \\npaper map can shrink, stretch, or tear over time, changing the dimensions of the scene. Input errors \\ncreated from hastily digitized points are common. Finally, converting between coordinate systems \\nand transforming between data points may also introduce errors to the dataset. \\nThe root-mean square (RMS) error is frequently used to evaluate the degree of inaccuracy in a \\ndigitized map. This statistic measures the deviation between the actual (true) and estimated \\n(digitized) locations of the control points. Figure 5.14 \"Potential Digitization Error\" illustrates the \\ninaccuracies of lines representing soil types that result from input control point location errors. By \\napplying an RMS error calculation to the dataset, one could determine the accuracy of the digitized \\nmap and thus determine its suitability for inclusion in a given study. \\nFigure 5.14 Potential Digitization Error \\n \\nPositional errors can also arise when features to be mapped are inherently vague. Take the example \\nof a wetland (Figure 5.15 \"Defining a Wetland Boundary\"). What defines a wetland boundary? \\nWetlands are determined by a combination of hydrologic, vegetative, and edaphic factors. Although \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers is currently responsible for defining the boundary of wetlands \\nthroughout the country, this task is not as simple as it may seem. In particular, regional differences \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  133 \\nin the characteristics of a wetland make delineating these features particularly troublesome. For \\nexample, the definition of a wetland boundary for the riverine wetlands in the eastern United States, \\nwhere water is abundant, is often useless when delineating similar types of wetlands in the desert \\nsouthwest United States. Indeed, the complexity and confusion associated with the conception of \\nwhat a \u201cwetland\u201d is may result in difficulties defining the feature in the field, which subsequently \\nleads to positional accuracy errors in the GIS database. \\nFigure 5.15 Defining a Wetland Boundary \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  134 \\nIn addition to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy is a common source of error in a GIS. Attribute \\nerrors can occur when an incorrect value is recorded within the attribute field or when a field is \\nmissing a value. Misspelled words and other typographical errors are common as well. Similarly, a \\ncommon inaccuracy occurs when developers enter \u201c0\u201d in an attribute field when the value is actually \\n\u201cnull.\u201d This is common in count data where \u201c0\u201d would represent zero findings, while a \u201cnull\u201d would \\nrepresent a locale where no data collection effort was undertaken. In the case of categorical values, \\ninaccuracies occasionally occur when attributes are mislabeled. For example, a land-use/land-cover \\nmap may list a polygon as \u201cagricultural\u201d when it is, in fact, \u201cresidential.\u201d This is particularly true if \\nthe dataset is out of date, which leads us to our next source of error. \\nTemporal accuracy addresses the age or timeliness of a dataset. No dataset is ever completely current. \\nIn the time it takes to create the dataset, it has already become outdated. Regardless, there are \\nseveral dates to be aware of while using a dataset. These dates should be found within the metadata. \\nThe publication date will tell you when the dataset was created and/or released. The field date relates \\nthe date and time the data was collected. If the dataset contains any future prediction, there should \\nalso be a forecast period and/or date. To address temporal accuracy, many datasets undergo a \\nregular data update regimen. For example, the California Department of Fish and Game updates its \\nsensitive species databases on a near monthly basis as new findings are continually being made. It is \\nimportant to ensure that, as an end-user, you are constantly using the most up-to-date data for your \\nGIS application. \\nThe fourth type of accuracy in a GIS is logical consistency. Logical consistency requires that the data \\nare topologically correct. For example, does a stream segment of a line shapefile fall within the \\nfloodplain of the corresponding polygon shapefile? Do roadways connect at nodes? Do all the \\nconnections and flows point in the correct direction in a network? In regards to the last question, the \\nauthor was recently using an unnamed smartphone application to navigate a busy city roadway and \\nwas twice told to turn the wrong direction down one-way streets. So beware, errors in logical \\nconsistency may lead to traffic violations, or worse! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  135 \\nThe final type of accuracy is data completeness. Comprehensive inclusion of all features within the \\nGIS database is required to ensure accurate mapping results. Simply put, all the data must be present \\nfor a dataset to be accurate. Are all of the counties in the state represented? Are all of the stream \\nsegments included in the river network? Is every convenience store listed in the database? Are only \\ncertain types of convenience stores listed within the database? Indeed, incomplete data will \\ninevitably lead to incomplete or insufficient analysis. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 All geospatial data contains error. \\n\u2022 Accuracy represents how close a measurement is to its actual value, while precision refers to the variance \\nof a value when repeated measurements are taken. \\n\u2022 The five types of error in a geospatial dataset are related to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, \\ntemporal accuracy, logical consistency, and data completeness. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the five types of accuracy/precision errors associated geographic information? Provide an \\nexample of each type of error. \\n2. Per the description of the positional accuracy of wetland boundaries, discuss a map feature whose \\nboundaries are inherently vague and difficult to map. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  136 \\nChapter 6 \\n \\nData Characteristics and Visualization \\nIn previous chapters, we learned how geographic information system (GIS) software packages use \\ndatabases to store extensive attribute information for geospatial features within a map. The true \\nusefulness of this information, however, is not realized until similarly powerful analytical tools are \\nemployed to access, process, and simplify the data. To accomplish this, GIS typically provides \\nextensive tools for searching, querying, describing, summarizing, and classifying datasets. With these \\ndata exploration tools, even the most expansive datasets can be mined to provide users the ability to \\nmake meaningful insights into and statements about that information. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  137 \\n6.1 Descriptions and Summaries \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review the most frequently used measures of distribution, central \\ntendency, and dispersion. \\nNo discussion of geospatial analysis would be complete without a brief overview of basic statistical \\nconcepts. The basic statistics outlined here represent a starting point for any attempt to describe, \\nsummarize, and analyze geospatial datasets. An example of a common geospatial statistical endeavor \\nis the analysis of point data obtained by a series of rainfall gauges patterned throughout a particular \\nregion. Given these rain gauges, one could determine the typical amount and variability of rainfall at \\neach station, as well as typical rainfall throughout the region as a whole. In addition, you could \\ninterpolate the amount of rainfall that falls between each station or the location where the most (or \\nleast) rainfall occurs. Furthermore, you could predict the expected amount of rainfall into the future \\nat each station, between each station, or within the region as a whole. \\nThe increase of computational power over the past few decades has given rise to vast datasets that \\ncannot be summarized easily. Descriptive statistics provide simple numeric descriptions of these large \\ndatasets. Descriptive statistics tend to be univariate analyses, meaning they examine one variable at a \\ntime. There are three families of descriptive statistics that we will discuss here: measures of \\ndistribution, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion. However, before we delve \\ntoo deeply into various statistical techniques, we must first define a few terms. \\n\u2022 Variable: a symbol used to represent any given value or set of values  \\n\u2022 Value: an individual observation of a variable (in a geographic information system [GIS] this is \\nalso called a record) \\n\u2022 Population: the universe of all possible values for a variable \\n\u2022 Sample: a subset of the population \\n\u2022 n: the number of observations for a variable \\n\u2022 Array: a sequence of observed measures (in a GIS this is also called a field and is represented in \\nan attribute table as a column) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  138 \\n\u2022 Sorted Array: an ordered, quantitative array \\nMeasures of Distribution \\nThe measure of distribution of a variable is merely a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset (hence, this is often called a frequency distribution). Typically, the values for the given variable \\nwill be grouped into a predetermined series of classes (also called intervals, bins, or categories), and the \\nnumber of data values that fall into each class will be summarized. A graph showing the number of data \\nvalues within each class range is called a histogram. For example, the percentage grades received by a \\nclass on an exam may result in the following array (n = 30): \\nArray of Exam Scores: {87, 76, 89, 90, 64, 67, 59, 79, 88, 74, 72, 99, 81, 77, 75, 86, 94, 66, 75, 74, 83, \\n100, 92, 75, 73, 70, 60, 80, 85, 57} \\nWhen placing this array into a frequency distribution, the following general guidelines should be \\nobserved. First, between five and fifteen different classes should be employed, although the exact number \\nof classes depends on the number of observations. Second, each observation goes into one and only one \\nclass. Third, when possible, use classes that cover an equal range of values (Freund and Perles \\n2006). [1] With these guidelines in mind, the exam score array shown earlier can be visualized  with the \\nfollowing histogram (Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ). \\nFigure 6.1 Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  139 \\nAs you can see from the histogram, certain descriptive observations can be readily made. Most students \\nreceived a C on the exam (70\u201379). Two students failed the exam (50\u201359). Five students received an A \\n(90\u201399). Note that this histogram does violate the third basic rule that each class cover an equal range \\nbecause an F grade ranges from 0\u201359, whereas the other grades have ranges of equal size. Regardless, in \\nthis case we are most concerned with describing the distribution of grades received during the exam. \\nTherefore, it makes perfect sense to create class ranges that best suit ou r individual needs. \\nMeasures of Central Tendency \\nWe can further explore the exam score array by applying measures of central tendency. There are three \\nprimary measures of central tendency: the mean, mode, and median. The mean, more commonly referred \\nto as the average, is the most often used measure of central tendency. To calculate the mean, simply add \\nall the values in the array and divide that sum by the number of observations. To return to the exam score \\nexample from earlier, the sum of that array is 2,340, and there are 30 observations (n = 30). So, the mean \\nis 2,340 / 30 = 78. \\nThe mode is the measure of central tendency that represents the most frequently occurring value in the \\narray. In the case of the exam scores, the mode of the array is 75 as this w as received by the most number \\nof students (three, in total). Finally, the median is the observation that, when the array is ordered from \\nlowest to highest, falls exactly in the center of the sorted array. More specifically, the median is the value \\nin the middle of the sorted array when there are an odd number of observations. Alternatively, when there \\nis an even number of observations, the median is calculated by finding the mean of the two central values. \\nIf the array of exam scores were reordered into a sorted array, the scores would be listed thusly:  \\nSorted Array of Exam Scores: {57, 59, 60, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72, 73, 74, 74, 75, 75, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, \\n83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 99} \\nSince n = 30 in this example, there are an even number of observations. Therefore, the mean of the two \\ncentral values (15th = 76 and 16th = 77) is used to calculate the median as described earlier, resulting in (76 \\n+ 77) / 2 = 76.5. Taken together, the mean, mode, and median represent the most basic ways to exam ine \\ntrends in a dataset. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  140 \\nMeasures of Dispersion \\nThe third type of descriptive statistics is measures of dispersion (also referred to as measures of \\nvariability). These measures describe the spread of data around the mean. The simplest measure of \\ndispersion is the range. The range equals the largest value minus in the dataset the smallest. In our case, \\nthe range is 99 \u2212 57 = 42. \\nThe interquartile range represents a slightly more sophisticated measure of dispersion. This method \\ndivides the data into quartiles. To accomplish this, the median is used to divide the sorted array into two \\nhalves. These halves are again divided into halves by their own median. The first quartile (Q1) is the \\nmedian of the lower half of the sorted array and is also referred to as the lower quartile. Q2 represents the \\nmedian. Q3 is the median of the upper half of the sorted array and is referred to as the upper quartile. The \\ndifference between the upper and lower quartile is the interquartile range. In the exam score example, Q1 \\n= 72.25 and Q3 = 86.75. Therefore, the interquartile range for this dataset is 86.75 \u2212 72.25 = 14.50.  \\nA third measure of dispersion is the variance (s2). To calculate the variance, subtract the raw value of each \\nexam score from the mean of the exam scores. As you may guess, some of the differences will be positive, \\nand some will be negative, resulting in the sum of differences equaling zero. As we are more interested in \\nthe magnitude of differences (or deviations) from the mean, one method to overcome this \u201czeroing\u201d \\nproperty is to square each deviation, thus removing the negative values from the output ( Figure 6.2). This \\nresults in the following: \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  141 \\nFigure 6.2 \\n \\nWe then divide the sum of squares by either n \u2212 1 (in the case of working with a sample) or n (in the case \\nof working with a population). As the exam scores given here represent the entire population of the class, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  142 \\nwe will employ Figure 6.3 \"Variance\", which results in a variance of s2 = 116.4. If we wanted to use these \\nexam scores to extrapolate information about the larger student body, we would be working with a sample \\nof the population. In that case, we would divide the sum of squares by  n \u2212 1. \\nFigure 6.3 Variance \\n \\nStandard deviation, the final measure of dispersion discussed here, is the most commonly used measure \\nof dispersion. To compensate for the squaring of each difference from the mean performed during the \\nvariance calculation, standard deviation takes the square root of the variance. As determined from Figure \\n6.4 \"Standard Deviation\", our exam score example results in a standard deviation of s = SQRT(116.4) = \\n10.8. \\nFigure 6.4 Standard Deviation \\n \\nCalculating the standard deviation allows us to make some notable inferences about the dispersion of our \\ndataset. A small standard deviation suggests the values in the dataset are clustered around the mean, \\nwhile a large standard deviation suggests the values are scattered widely around the mean. Additional \\ninferences may be made about the standard deviation if the dataset conforms to a normal distribution. A \\nnormal distribution implies that the data, when placed into a frequency distribution (histogram), looks \\nsymmetrical or \u201cbell-shaped.\u201d When not \u201cnormal,\u201d the frequency distribution of dataset is said to be \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  143 \\npositively or negatively \u201cskewed\u201d (Figure 6.5 \"Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and \\nNegatively Skewed Datasets\"). Skewed data are those that maintain values that are not symmetrical \\naround the mean. Regardless, normally distributed data maintains the property of having approxim ately \\n68 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 95 percent of the data \\nvalue fall within \u00b1 2 standard deviations of the mean. In our example, the mean is 78, and the standard \\ndeviation is 10.8. It can therefore be stated that 68 percent of the scores fall between 67.2 and 88.8 (i.e., \\n78 \u00b1 10.8), while 95 percent of the scores fall between 56.4 and 99.6 (i.e., 78 \u00b1 [10.8 * 2]). For datasets \\nthat do not conform to the normal curve, it can be assumed that 75 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 \\n2 standard deviations of the mean. \\nFigure 6.5 Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and Negatively Skewed Datasets \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The measure of distribution for a given variable is a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset and is commonly shown using a histogram. \\n\u2022 Measures of central tendency attempt to provide insights into \u201ctypical\u201d value for a dataset.  \\n\u2022 Measures of dispersion (or variability) describe the spread of data around the mean o r median. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to outline the basics of the SQL language and to understand the various \\nquery techniques available in a GIS. \\nAccess to robust search and query tools is essential to examine the general trends of a dataset.  Queries are \\nessentially questions posed to a database. The selective display and retrieval of information based on \\nthese queries are essential components of any geographic information system (GIS). There are three basic \\nmethods for searching and querying attribute data: (1) selection, (2) query by attribute, and (3) query by \\ngeography. \\nSelection \\nSelection represents the easiest way to search and query spatial data in a GIS. Sele cting features highlight \\nthose attributes of interest, both on-screen and in the attribute table, for subsequent display or analysis. \\nTo accomplish this, one selects points, lines, and polygons simply by using the cursor to \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d \\nthe feature of interest or by using the cursor to drag a box around those features. Alternatively, one can \\nselect features by using a graphic object, such as a circle, line, or polygon, to highlight all of those features \\nthat fall within the object. Advanced options for selecting subsets of data from the larger dataset include \\ncreating a new selection, selecting from the currently selected features, adding to the current selection, \\nand removing from the current selection. \\nQuery by Attribute \\nMap features and their associated data can be retrieved via the query of attribute information within the \\ndata tables. For example, search and query tools allow a user to show all the census tracts that have a \\npopulation density of 500 or greater, to show all counties that are less than or equal to 100 square \\nkilometers, or to show all convenience stores within 1 mile of an interstate highway.  \\nSpecifically, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a commonly used computer language developed to \\nquery attribute data within a relational database management system. Created by IBM in the 1970s, SQL Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  145 \\nallows for the retrieval of a subset of attribute information based on specific, user -defined criteria via the \\nimplementation of particular language elements. More recently, the use of SQL has been extended for use \\nin a GIS (Shekhar and Chawla 2003).[1] One important note related to the use of SQL is that the exact \\nexpression used to query a dataset depends on the GIS file format being examined. For example, ANSI \\nSQL is a particular version used to query ArcSDE geodatabases, while Jet SQL is used to access personal \\ngeodatabases. Similarly, shapefiles, coverages, and dBASE tables use a restricted version of SQL that \\ndoesn\u2019t support all the features of ANSI SQL or Jet SQL. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.2 \"Geospatial Database \\nManagement\", all attribute tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for an SQL \\nquery must contain primary and/or foreign keys for proper use. In addition to these keys, SQL \\nimplements clauses to structure database queries. A clause is a language element that includes the \\nSELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING query statements.  \\n\u2022 SELECT denotes what attribute table fields you wish to view. \\n\u2022 FROM denotes the attribute table in which the information resides.  \\n\u2022 WHERE denotes the user-defined criteria for the attribute information that must be met in order \\nfor it to be included in the output set. \\n\u2022 ORDER BY denotes the sequence in which the output set will be displayed.  \\n\u2022 HAVING denotes the predicate used to filter output from the ORDER BY clause.  \\nWhile the SELECT and FROM clauses are both mandatory statements in an SQL query, the WHERE is an \\noptional clause used to limit the output set. The ORDER BY and HAVING are optional clauses used to \\npresent the information in an interpretable manner. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  146 \\nFigure 6.6 Personal Addresses in \u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table \\n \\nThe following is a series of SQL expressions and results when applied to Figure 6.6 \"Personal Addresses in \\n\u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table\". The title of the attribute table is \u201cExampleTable.\u201d Note that the asterisk \\n(*) denotes a special case of SELECT whereby all columns for a given record are selected:  \\nSELECT * FROM ExampleTable WHERE City = \u201cUpland\u201d \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  147 \\nThis statement returns the following: \\n \\nConsider the following statement: \\nSELECT LastName FROM ExampleTable WHERE State = \u201cCA\u201d ORDER BY FirstName \\nThis statement results in the following table sorted in ascending order by the FirstName column (not \\nincluded in the output table as directed by the SELECT clause): \\n \\nIn addition to clauses, SQL allows for the inclusion of specific operators to further delimit the result of \\nquery. These operators can be relational, arithmetic, or Boolean and will typically appear inside of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  148 \\nconditional statements in the WHERE clause. A relational operator employs the statements equal to (=), \\nless than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), or greater than or equal to \\n(>=). Arithmetic operators are those mathematical functions that include addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), \\nmultiplication (*), and division (/). Boolean operators (also called Boolean connectors) include the \\nstatements AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. The AND connector is used to select records from the attribute \\ntable that satisfies both expressions. The OR connector selects records that satisfy either one or both \\nexpressions. The XOR connector selects records that satisfy one and only one of the expressions (the \\nfunctional opposite of the AND connector). Lastly, the NOT connector is used to negate (or unsele ct) an \\nexpression that would otherwise be true. Put into the language of probability, the AND connector is used \\nto represent an intersection, OR represents a union, and NOT represents a complement.  Figure 6.7 \"Venn \\nDiagram of SQL Operators\" illustrates the logic of these connectors, where circles A and B represent two \\nsets of intersecting data. Keep in mind that SQL is a very exacting language and minor inconsistencies in \\nthe statement, such as additional spaces, can result in a failed query.  \\nFigure 6.7 Venn Diagram of SQL Operators \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  149 \\nUsed together, these operators combine to provide the GIS user with powerful and flexible search and \\nquery options.

For example, a GIS provides robust tools that allow for \\nthe determination of the number of schools within 10 miles of a home. Several spatial query options are \\navailable, as outlined here. Throughout this discussion, the \u201ctarget layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset \\nwhose attributes are selected, while the \u201csource layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset on which the spatial \\nquery is applied. For example, if we were to use a state boundary polygon feature dataset to select \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  150 \\nhighways from a line feature dataset (e.g., select all the highways that run through the state of Arkansas), \\nthe state layer is the source, while the highway layer is the target.  \\n\u2022 INTERSECT. This oft-used spatial query technique selects all features in the target layer that \\nshare a common locale with the source layer. The \u201cintersect\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used as both the source and target layers (Figure 6.8). \\nFigure 6.8 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  151 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they intersect the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE WITHIN A DISTANCE OF. This technique requires the user to specify some distance \\nvalue, which is then used to buffer (Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", Section \\n7.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") the source layer. All features that intersect this buffer are \\nhighlighted in the target layer. The \u201care within a distance of\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used for both the source and target layers (Figure 6.9). \\nFigure 6.9 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  152 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are within the selected distance \\nof the red features; tan areas represent buffers around the various features. \\n\u2022 COMPLETELY CONTAIN. This spatial query technique returns those features that are entirely \\nwithin the source layer. Features with coincident boundaries are not selected by this query type. \\nThe \u201ccompletely contain\u201d query allows for points, lines, or polygons as the source layer, but only \\npolygons can be used as a target layer (Figure 6.10). \\nFigure 6.10 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they completely contain the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 ARE COMPLETELY WITHIN.

This technique selects target features whose center, or centroid, is \\nlocated within the boundary of the source feature dataset. The \u201chave their center in\u201d query allows \\npoints, lines, or polygon layers to be used as both the source and target layers ( Figure 6.12). \\nFigure 6.12 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  154 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they have their centers in the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 SHARE A LINE SEGMENT. This spatial query selects target features whose boundary \\ngeometries share a minimum of two adjacent vertices with the source layer. The \u201cshare a line \\nsegment\u201d query allows for line or polygon layers to be used for either of the source and target \\nlayers (Figure 6.13). \\nFigure 6.13 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  155 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they share a line segment with the \\nred features. \\n\u2022 TOUCH THE BOUNDARY OF.

This selection criteria returns features that share a \\nsingle vertex but not an entire line segment.

The objective of this section is to describe the methodologies available to parse data into various classes \\nfor visual representation in a map. \\nThe process of data classification combines raw data into predefined classes, or bins. These classes \\nmay be represented in a map by some unique symbols or, in the case of choropleth maps, by a unique \\ncolor or hue (for more on color and hue, see Chapter 8 \"Geospatial Analysis II: Raster Data\", Section \\n8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"). Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated \\ncolors to represent some statistical variable of interest. Although seemingly straightforward, there \\nare several different classification methodologies available to a cartographer. These methodologies \\nbreak the attribute values down along various interval patterns. Monmonier (1991) [1]noted that \\ndifferent classification methodologies can have a major impact on the interpretability of a given map \\nas the visual pattern presented is easily distorted by manipulating the specific interval breaks of the \\nclassification. In addition to the methodology employed, the number of classes chosen to represent \\nthe feature of interest will also significantly affect the ability of the viewer to interpret the mapped \\ninformation. Including too many classes can make a map look overly complex and confusing. Too \\nfew classes can oversimplify the map and hide important data trends. Most effective classification \\nattempts utilize approximately four to six distinct classes. \\nWhile problems potentially exist with any classification technique, a well-constructed choropleth \\nincreases the interpretability of any given map. The following discussion outlines the classification \\nmethods commonly available in geographic information system (GIS) software packages. In these \\nexamples, we will use the US Census Bureau\u2019s population statistic for US counties in 1997. These \\ndata are freely available at the US Census website (http://www.census.gov). \\nThe equal interval (or equal step) classification method divides the range of attribute values into \\nequally sized classes. The number of classes is determined by the user. The equal interval \\nclassification method is best used for continuous datasets such as precipitation or temperature. In \\nthe case of the 1997 Census Bureau data, county population values across the United States range Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  162 \\nfrom 40 (Yellowstone National Park County, MO) to 9,184,770 (Los Angeles County, CA) for a total \\nrange of 9,184,770 \u2212 40 = 9,184,730. If we decide to classify this data into 5 equal interval classes, \\nthe range of each class would cover a population spread of 9,184,730 / 5 = 1,836,946 (Figure 6.19 \\n\"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data\"). The advantage of the equal \\ninterval classification method is that it creates a legend that is easy to interpret and present to a \\nnontechnical audience. The primary disadvantage is that certain datasets will end up with most of \\nthe data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will occupy the other \\nclasses. As you can see in Figure 6.19 \"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population \\nData\", almost all the counties are assigned to the first (yellow) bin. \\nFigure 6.19 Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  163 \\nThe quantile classification method places equal numbers of observations into each class. This method \\nis best for data that is evenly distributed across its range. Figure 6.20 \"Quantiles\" shows the quantile \\nclassification method with five total classes. As there are 3,140 counties in the United States, each \\nclass in the quantile classification methodology will contain 3,140 / 5 = 628 different counties. The \\nadvantage to this method is that it often excels at emphasizing the relative position of the data values \\n(i.e., which counties contain the top 20 percent of the US population). The primary disadvantage of \\nthe quantile classification methodology is that features placed within the same class can have wildly \\ndiffering values, particularly if the data are not evenly distributed across its range. In addition, the \\nopposite can also happen whereby values with small range differences can be placed into different \\nclasses, suggesting a wider difference in the dataset than actually exists. \\nFigure 6.20 Quantiles \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  164 \\nThe natural breaks (or Jenks) classification method utilizes an algorithm to group values in classes \\nthat are separated by distinct break points. This method is best used with data that is unevenly \\ndistributed but not skewed toward either end of the distribution. Figure 6.21 \"Natural Breaks\" shows \\nthe natural breaks classification for the 1997 US county population density data. One potential \\ndisadvantage is that this method can create classes that contain widely varying number ranges. \\nAccordingly, class 1 is characterized by a range of just over 150,000, while class 5 is characterized by \\na range of over 6,000,000. In cases like this, it is often useful to either \u201ctweak\u201d the classes following \\nthe classification effort or to change the labels to some ordinal scale such as \u201csmall, medium, or \\nlarge.\u201d The latter example, in particular, can result in a map that is more comprehensible to the \\nviewer. A second disadvantage is the fact that it can be difficult to compare two or more maps created \\nwith the natural breaks classification method because the class ranges are so very specific to each \\ndataset. In these cases, datasets that may not be overly disparate may appear so in the output \\ngraphic. \\nFigure 6.21 Natural Breaks \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  165 \\nFinally, the standard deviation classification method forms each class by adding and subtracting the \\nstandard deviation from the mean of the dataset. The method is best suited to be used with data that \\nconforms to a normal distribution. In the county population example, the mean is 85,108, and the \\nstandard deviation is 277,080. Therefore, as can be seen in the legend of Figure 6.22 \"Standard \\nDeviation\", the central class contains values within a 0.5 standard deviation of the mean, while the \\nupper and lower classes contain values that are 0.5 or more standard deviations above or below the \\nmean, respectively. \\nFigure 6.22 Standard Deviation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  166 \\nIn conclusion, there are several viable data classification methodologies that can be applied to \\nchoropleth maps. Although other methods are available (e.g., equal area, optimal), those outlined \\nhere represent the most commonly used and widely available. Each of these methods presents the \\ndata in a different fashion and highlights different aspects of the trends in the dataset. Indeed, the \\nclassification methodology, as well as the number of classes utilized, can result in very widely varying \\ninterpretations of the dataset. It is incumbent upon you, the cartographer, to select the method that \\nbest suits the needs of the study and presents the data in as meaningful and transparent a way as \\npossible. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated colors to represent some statistical variable \\nof interest. \\n\u2022 Four methods for classifying data presented here include equal intervals, quartile, natural breaks, and \\nstandard deviation.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the variety of single \\noverlay analysis techniques available to analyze and manipulate the spatial attributes of a vector feature \\ndataset. \\nAs the name suggests, single layer analyses are those that are undertaken on an individual feature \\ndataset. Buffering is the process of creating an output polygon layer containing a zone (or zones) of a \\nspecified width around an input point, line, or polygon feature. Buffers are particularly suited for \\ndetermining the area of influence around features of interest. Geoprocessing is a suite of tools \\nprovided by many geographic information system (GIS) software packages that allow the user to \\nautomate many of the mundane tasks associated with manipulating GIS data. Geoprocessing usually \\ninvolves the input of one or more feature datasets, followed by a spatially explicit analysis, and \\nresulting in an output feature dataset. \\nBuffering \\nBuffers are common vector analysis tools used to address questions of proximity in a GIS and can be used \\non points, lines, or polygons (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features\" ). For \\ninstance, suppose that a natural resource manager wants to ensure that no areas are disturbed within \\n1,000 feet of breeding habitat for the federally endangered Delhi Sands flower- loving fly (Rhaphiomidas \\nterminatus abdominalis). This species is found only in the few remaining Delhi Sands soil formations of \\nthe western United States. To accomplish this task, a 1,000-foot protection zone (buffer) could be created \\naround all the observed point locations of the species. Alternatively, the manager may decide th at there is \\nnot enough point-specific location information related to this rare species and decide to protect all Delhi \\nSands soil formations. In this case, he or she could create a 1,000-foot buffer around all polygons labeled \\nas \u201cDelhi Sands\u201d on a soil formations dataset. In either case, the use of buffers provides a quick-and-easy \\ntool for determining which areas are to be maintained as preserved habitat for the endangered fly.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  169 \\nFigure 7.1 Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features \\n \\nSeveral buffering options are available to refine the output. For example, the buffer tool will typically \\nbuffer only selected features. If no features are selected, all features will be buffered. Two primary types of \\nbuffers are available to the GIS users: constant width and variable width. Constant width buffersrequire \\nusers to input a value by which features are buffered (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and \\nPolygon Features\"), such as is seen in the examples in the preceding paragraph. Variable width buffers, on \\nthe other hand, call on a premade buffer field within the attribute table to determine the buffer width for \\neach specific feature in the dataset (Figure 7.2 \"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) \\nVariable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple Ring Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) \\nNondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\"). \\nIn addition, users can choose to dissolve or not dissolve the boundaries between overlapping, coincident \\nbuffer areas. Multiple ring buffers can be made such that a series of concentric buffer zones (much like an \\narchery target) are created around the originating feature at user- specified distances (Figure 7.2 \\n\"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multi ple Ring Buffers, \\n(c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\" ). In the case of \\npolygon layers, buffers can be created that include the originating polygon feature as part of the buffer or \\nthey be created as a doughnut buffer that excludes the input polygon area. Setback buffers are similar to \\ndoughnut buffers; however, they only buffer the area inside of the polygon boundary. Linear features can \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  170 \\nbe buffered on both sides of the line, only on the left, or only on t he right. Linear features can also be \\nbuffered so that the end points of the line are rounded (ending in a half- circle) or flat (ending in a \\nrectangle). \\nFigure 7.2 Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple \\nRing Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer \\n \\nGeoprocessing Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  171 \\n\u201cGeoprocessing\u201d is a loaded term in the field of GIS. The term can (and should) be widely applied to any \\nattempt to manipulate GIS data. However, the term came into common usage due to its application to a \\nsomewhat arbitrary suite of single layer and multiple layer analytical techniques in the Geoprocessing \\nWizard of ESRI\u2019s ArcView software package in the mid-1990s. Regardless, the suite of geoprocessing tools \\navailable in a GIS greatly expand and simplify many of the management and manipulation processes \\nassociated with vector feature datasets. The primary use of these tools is to automate the repetitive \\npreprocessing needs of typical spatial analyses and to assemble exact graphical representations for \\nsubsequent analysis and/or inclusion in presentations and final mapping products. The union, intersect, \\nsymmetrical difference, and identity overlay methods discussed in Section 7.2.2 \"Other Multilayer \\nGeoprocessing Options\" are often used in conjunction with these geoprocessing tools. The following \\nrepresents the most common geoprocessing tools. \\nThe dissolve operation combines adjacent polygon features in a single feature dataset based o n a single \\npredetermined attribute. For example, part (a) ofFigure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing \\nFunctions\" shows the boundaries of seven different parcels of land, owned by four different families \\n(labeled 1 through 4). The dissolve tool automatically combines all adjacent features with the same \\nattribute values. The result is an output layer with the same extent as the original but without all of the \\nunnecessary, intervening line segments. The dissolved output layer is much easier to visually interpret \\nwhen the map is classified according to the dissolved field. \\nThe append operation creates an output polygon layer by combining the spatial extent of two or more \\nlayers (part (d) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). For use with point, line, and \\npolygon datasets, the output layer will be the same feature type as the input layers (which must each be \\nthe same feature type as well). Unlike the dissolve tool, append does not remove the boundary lines \\nbetween appended layers (in the case of lines and polygons). Therefore, it is often useful to perform a \\ndissolve after the use of the append tool to remove these potentially unnecessary dividing lines. Append is \\nfrequently used to mosaic data layers, such as digital US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5- minute \\ntopographic maps, to create a single map for analysis and/or display.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  172 \\nThe select operation creates an output layer based on a user-defined query that selects particular features \\nfrom the input layer (part (f) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). The output layer \\ncontains only those features that are selected during the query. For example, a city planner may choose to \\nperform a select on all areas that are zoned \u201cresidential\u201d so he or she can quickly assess which areas in \\ntown are suitable for a proposed housing development. \\nFinally, the merge operation combines features within a point, line, or polygon layer into a single feature \\nwith identical attribute information. Often, the original features will have different values for a given \\nattribute. In this case, the first attribute encountered is carried over into the attribute table, and the \\nremaining attributes are lost. This operation is particularly useful when polygons are found to be \\nunintentionally overlapping. Merge will conveniently combine these features into a single entity. \\nFigure 7.3 Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Buffers are frequently used to create zones of a specified width around points, lines, and polygons.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  173 \\n\u2022 Vector buffering options include constant or variable widths, multiple rings, doughnuts, setbacks, and \\ndissolve. \\n\u2022 Common single layer geoprocessing operations on vector layers include dissolve, merge, append, and \\nselect. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the implementation \\nof basic multiple layer operations and methodologies used on vector feature datasets.  \\nAmong the most powerful and commonly used tools in a geographic information system (GIS) is the \\noverlay of cartographic information. In a GIS, an overlay is the process of taking two or more \\ndifferent thematic maps of the same area and placing them on top of one another to form a new map \\n(Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector Layers, as \\nWell as Raster Layers\"). Inherent in this process, the overlay function combines not only the spatial \\nfeatures of the dataset but also the attribute information as well. \\nFigure 7.4 A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector \\nLayers, as Well as Raster Layers \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  175 \\nA common example used to illustrate the overlay process is, \u201cWhere is the best place to put a mall?\u201d \\nImagine you are a corporate bigwig and are tasked with determining where your company\u2019s next \\nshopping mall will be placed. How would you attack this problem? With a GIS at your command, \\nanswering such spatial questions begins with amassing and overlaying pertinent spatial data layers. \\nFor example, you may first want to determine what areas can support the mall by accumulating \\ninformation on which land parcels are for sale and which are zoned for commercial development. \\nAfter collecting and overlaying the baseline information on available development zones, you can \\nbegin to determine which areas offer the most economic opportunity by collecting regional \\ninformation on average household income, population density, location of proximal shopping \\ncenters, local buying habits, and more. Next, you may want to collect information on restrictions or \\nroadblocks to development such as the cost of land, cost to develop the land, community response to \\ndevelopment, adequacy of transportation corridors to and from the proposed mall, tax rates, and so \\nforth. Indeed, simply collecting and overlaying spatial datasets provides a valuable tool for \\nvisualizing and selecting the optimal site for such a business endeavor. \\nOverlay Operations \\nSeveral basic overlay processes are available in a GIS for vector datasets: point -in-polygon, polygon-on-\\npoint, line-on-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-on-polygon. As you may be able to \\ndivine from the names, one of the overlay dataset must always be a line or polygon layer, while the second \\nmay be point, line, or polygon. The new layer produced following the overlay operation is termed the \\n\u201coutput\u201d layer. \\nThe point-in-polygon overlay operation requires a point input layer and a polygon overlay layer. Upon \\nperforming this operation, a new output point layer is returned that includes  all the points that occur \\nwithin the spatial extent of the overlay (Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, \\nLine, and Polygon Vector Layers, as Well as Raster Layers\"). In addition, all the points in the output layer \\ncontain their original attribute information as well as the attribute information from the overlay. For \\nexample, suppose you were tasked with determining if an endangered species residing in a national park \\nwas found primarily in a particular vegetation community. The first step would be to acquire the point Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  176 \\noccurrence locales for the species in question, plus a polygon overlay layer showing the vegetation \\ncommunities within the national park boundary. Upon performing the point -in-polygon overlay \\noperation, a new point file is created that contains all the points that occur within the national park. The \\nattribute table of this output point file would also contain information about the vegetation communities \\nbeing utilized by the species at the time of observation. A quick sca n of this output layer and its attribute \\ntable would allow you to determine where the species was found in the park and to review the vegetation \\ncommunities in which it occurred. This process would enable park employees to make informed \\nmanagement decisions regarding which onsite habitats to protect to ensure continued site utilization by \\nthe species. \\nFigure 7.5 Point-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nAs its name suggests, the polygon-on-point overlay operation is the opposite of the point-in-polygon \\noperation. In this case, the polygon layer is the input, while the point layer is the overlay. The polygon \\nfeatures that overlay these points are selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For  \\nexample, given a point dataset containing the locales of some type of crime and a polygon dataset \\nrepresenting city blocks, a polygon-on-point overlay operation would allow police to select the city blocks \\nin which crimes have been known to occur and hence determine those locations where an increased police \\npresence may be warranted. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  177 \\nFigure 7.6 Polygon-on-Point Overlay \\n \\nA line-on-line overlay operation requires line features for both the input and overlay layer. The output \\nfrom this operation is a point or points located precisely at the intersection(s) of the two linear datasets \\n(Figure 7.7 \"Line-on-Line Overlay\"). For example, a linear feature dataset containing railroad tracks may \\nbe overlain on linear road network. The resulting point dataset contain s all the locales of the railroad \\ncrossings over a town\u2019s road network. The attribute table for this railroad crossing point dataset would \\ncontain information on both the railroad and the road over which it passed.  \\nFigure 7.7 Line-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nThe line-in-polygon overlay operation is similar to the point-in-polygon overlay, with that obvious \\nexception that a line input layer is used instead of a point input layer. In this case, each line that has any \\npart of its extent within the overlay polygon layer will be included in the output line layer, although these \\nlines will be truncated at the boundary of the overlay (Figure 7.9 \"Polygon-on-Line Overlay\"). For \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  178 \\nexample, a line-in-polygon overlay can take an input layer of interstate line segments and a polygon \\noverlay representing city boundaries and produce a linear output layer of highway segments that fall \\nwithin the city boundary. The attribute table for the output interstate line segment will contain \\ninformation on the interstate name as well as the city through which they pass. \\nFigure 7.8 Line-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe polygon-on-line overlay operation is the opposite of the line-in-polygon operation. In this case, the \\npolygon layer is the input, while the line layer is the overlay. The polygon featu res that overlay these lines \\nare selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For example, given a layer containing the \\npath of a series of telephone poles/wires and a polygon map contain city parcels, a polygon -on-line \\noverlay operation would allow a land assessor to select those parcels containing overhead telephone wires.  \\nFigure 7.9 Polygon-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  179 \\nFinally, the polygon-in-polygon overlay operation employs a polygon input and a polygon overlay. This is \\nthe most commonly used overlay operation. Using this method, the polygon input and overlay layers are \\ncombined to create an output polygon layer with the extent of the overlay. The attribute table will contain \\nspatial data and attribute information from both the input and overlay layers ( Figure 7.10 \"Polygon-in-\\nPolygon Overlay\"). For example, you may choose an input polygon layer of soil types with an overlay of \\nagricultural fields within a given county. The output polygon layer would contain information on both the \\nlocation of agricultural fields and soil types throughout the county.  \\nFigure 7.10 Polygon-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe overlay operations discussed previously assume that the user desires the overlain layers to be \\ncombined. This is not always the case. Overlay methods can be more complex than that and therefore \\nemploy the basic Boolean operators: AND, OR, and XOR (see Section 6.1.2 \"Measures of Central \\nTendency\"). Depending on which operator(s) are utilized, the overlay method employed will result in an \\nintersection, union, symmetrical difference, or identity. \\nSpecifically, the union overlay method employs the OR operator. A union can be used only in the case of \\ntwo polygon input layers. It preserves all features, attribute information, and spatial extents from both \\ninput layers (part (a) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). This overlay method is based on the \\npolygon-in-polygon operation described in Section 7.1.1 \"Buffering\". \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  180 \\nAlternatively, the intersection overlay method employs the AND operator. An intersection requires a \\npolygon overlay, but can accept a point, line, or polygon input. The output layer covers the spatial extent \\nof the overlay and contains features and attributes from both the input and overlay (part (b) of Figure 7.11 \\n\"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nThe symmetrical difference overlay method employs the XOR operator, which results in the opposite \\noutput as an intersection. This method requires both input layers to be polygons. The output polygon \\nlayer produced by the symmetrical difference method represents those areas common to only one of the \\nfeature datasets (part (c) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nIn addition to these simple operations, the identity (also referred to as \u201cminus\u201d) overlay method creates \\nan output layer with the spatial extent of the input layer (part (d) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \\n\") but includes attribute information from the overlay (referred to as the \u201cidentity\u201d layer, in this case). The \\ninput layer can be points, lines, or polygons. The identity layer must be a p olygon dataset. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  181 \\nFigure 7.11 Vector Overlay Methods \\n \\nOther Multilayer Geoprocessing Options \\nIn addition to the aforementioned vector overlay methods, other common multiple layer geoprocessing \\noptions are available to the user. These included the clip, erase, and split tools. The  clip geoprocessing \\noperation is used to extract those features from an input point, line, or polygon layer that falls within the \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  182 \\nspatial extent of the clip layer (part (e) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). Following the clip, all \\nattributes from the preserved portion of the input layer are included in the output. If any features are \\nselected during this process, only those selected features within the clip boundary will be included in the \\noutput. For example, the clip tool could be used to clip the extent of a river floodplain by the extent of a \\ncounty boundary. This would provide county managers with insight into which portions of the floodplain \\nthey are responsible to maintain. This is similar to the intersect overlay method; however, the attribute \\ninformation associated with the clip layer is not carried into the output layer following the overlay.  \\nThe erase geoprocessing operation is essentially the opposite of a clip. Whereas the clip tool preserves \\nareas within an input layer, the erase tool preserves only those areas outside the extent of the analogous \\nerase layer (part (f) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). While the input layer can be a point, line, or \\npolygon dataset, the erase layer must be a polygon dataset. Continuing with our clip example, county \\nmanagers could then use the erase tool to erase the areas of private ownership within the county \\nfloodplain area. Officials could then focus specifically on public reaches of the countywide floodplain for \\ntheir upkeep and maintenance responsibilities. \\nThe split geoprocessing operation is used to divide an input layer into two or more layers based on a split \\nlayer (part (g) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). The split layer must be a polygon, while the input \\nlayers can be point, line, or polygon. For example, a homeowner\u2019s association may choose to split up a \\ncountywide soil series map by parcel boundaries so each homeowner has a specific soil map for their own \\nparcel. \\nSpatial Join \\nA spatial join is a hybrid between an attribute operation and a vector overlay operation. Like the \u201cjoin\u201d \\nattribute operation described in Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\", a spatial join results in the combination \\nof two feature dataset tables by a common attribute field. Unlike the attribute operation, a spatial join \\ndetermines which fields from a source layer\u2019s attribute table are appended to the destination layer\u2019s \\nattribute table based on the relative locations of selected features. This relationship is explicitly based on \\nthe property of proximity or containment between the source and destination layers, rather than the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  183 \\nprimary or secondary keys. The proximity option is used when the source layer is a point or line feature \\ndataset, while the containment option is used when the source layer is a polygon feature dataset. \\nWhen employing the proximity (or \u201cnearest\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the closest given feature in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table. The \\nproximity option will typically add a numerical field to the destination layer attribute table, called \\n\u201cDistance,\u201d within which the measured distance between the source and destination feature is placed. For \\nexample, suppose a city agency had a point dataset showing all known polluters in town and a line dataset \\nof all the river segments within the municipal boundary. This agency could then perform a proximity -\\nbased spatial join to determine the nearest river segment that would most likely be affected by each \\npolluter. \\nWhen using the containment (or \u201cinside\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the polygon source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the record in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table that it contains. If a \\ndestination layer feature (point, line, or polygon) is not completely contained within a source polygon, no \\nvalue will be appended. For example, suppose a pool cleaning business wanted to hone its marketing \\nservices by providing flyers only to homes that owned a pool. They could obtain a point dataset containing \\nthe location of every pool in the county and a polygon parcel map for that same area. That business could \\nthen conduct a spatial join to append the parcel information to the pool locales. This would provide them \\nwith information on the each land parcel that contained a pool and they could subsequently send their \\nmailers only to those homes. \\nOverlay Errors \\nAlthough overlays are one of the most important tools in a GIS analyst\u2019s toolbox, there are some problems \\nthat can arise when using this methodology. In particular, slivers are a common error produced when two \\nslightly misaligned vector layers are overlain (Figure 7.12 \"Slivers\"). This misalignment can come from \\nseveral sources including digitization errors, interpretation errors, or source map errors (Chang \\n2008). [1] For example, most vegetation and soil maps are created from field survey data, satellite images, \\nand aerial photography. While you can imagine that the boundaries of soils and vegetation frequently \\ncoincide, the fact that they were most likely created by different researchers at different times suggests Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  184 \\nthat their boundaries will not perfectly overlap. To ameliorate this problem, GIS software incorporates \\nacluster tolerance option that forces nearby lines to be snapped together if they fall within a user-specified \\ndistance. Care must be taken when assigning cluster tolerance. Too strict a setting will not snap shared \\nboundaries, while too lenient a setting will snap unintended, neighboring boundaries together (Wang and  \\nDonaghy 1995). [2] \\nFigure 7.12 Slivers \\n \\nA second potential source of error associated with the overlay process is error \\npropagation. Error propagation arises when inaccuracies are present in the original input and overlay \\nlayers and are propagated through to the output layer (MacDougall 1975).  [3] These errors can be related to \\npositional inaccuracies of the points, lines, or polygons. Alternatively, they can arise from attribute errors \\nin the original data table(s). Regardless of the source, error propagation represents a common problem in \\noverlay analysis, the impact of which depends largely on the accuracy and precision requirements of the \\nproject at hand. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, polygon-on-point, line-\\non-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-in-polygon models. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  185 \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Raster data are particularly suited to certain \\ntypes of analyses, such as basic geoprocessing (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"), \\nsurface analysis (Section 8.2 \"Scale of Analysis\"), and terrain mapping (Section 8.3 \"Surface \\nAnalysis: Spatial Interpolation\"). While not always true, raster data can simplify many types of \\nspatial analyses that would otherwise be overly cumbersome to perform on vector datasets. Some of \\nthe most common of these techniques are presented in this chapter. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  187 \\n8.1 Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to become familiar with basic single and multiple raster geoprocessing \\ntechniques. \\nLike the geoprocessing tools available for use on vector datasets (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing \\nwith Rasters\"), raster data can undergo similar spatial operations. Although the actual computation \\nof these operations is significantly different from their vector counterparts, their conceptual \\nunderpinning is similar. The geoprocessing techniques covered here include both single layer \\n(Section 8.1.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\") and multiple layer (Section 8.1.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") \\noperations. \\nSingle Layer Analysis \\nReclassifying, or recoding, a dataset is commonly one of the first steps undertaken during raster analysis. \\nReclassification is basically the single layer process of assigning a new class or range value to all pixels in \\nthe dataset based on their original values (Figure 8.1 \"Raster Reclassification\". For example, an elevation \\ngrid commonly contains a different value for nearly every cell within its extent. These values could be \\nsimplified by aggregating each pixel value in a few discrete classes (i.e., 0 \u2013100 = \u201c1,\u201d 101\u2013200 = \u201c2,\u201d 201\u2013\\n300 = \u201c3,\u201d etc.). This simplification allows for fewer unique values and cheaper storage requirements. In \\naddition, these reclassified layers are often used as inputs in secondary analyses, such as those discussed \\nlater in this section. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  188 \\nFigure 8.1 Raster Reclassification \\n \\nAs described in Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", buffering is the process of creating \\nan output dataset that contains a zone (or zones) of a specified width around an input feature. In the case \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  189 \\nof raster datasets, these input features are given as a grid cell or a group of grid cells containing a uniform  \\nvalue (e.g., buffer all cells whose value = 1). Buffers are particularly suited for determining the area of \\ninfluence around features of interest. Whereas buffering vector data results in a precise area of influence \\nat a specified distance from the target feature, raster buffers tend to be approximations representing those \\ncells that are within the specified distance range of the target (Figure 8.2 \"Raster Buffer around a Target \\nCell(s)\"). Most geographic information system (GIS) programs calculate raster buffers by creating a grid \\nof distance values from the center of the target cell(s) to the center of the neighboring cells and then \\nreclassifying those distances such that a \u201c1\u201d represents those cells composing the original target, a \u201c2\u201d \\nrepresents those cells within the user-defined buffer area, and a \u201c0\u201d represents those cells outside of the \\ntarget and buffer areas. These cells could also be further classified to represent multiple ring buffers by \\nincluding values of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d \u201c5,\u201d and so forth, to represent concentric distances around the target cell(s). \\nFigure 8.2 Raster Buffer around a Target Cell(s) \\n \\nMultiple Layer Analysis \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  190 \\nA raster dataset can also be clipped similar to a vector dataset (Figure 8.3 \"Clipping a Raster to a Vector \\nPolygon Layer\"). Here, the input raster is overlain by a vector polygon clip layer. The raster clip process \\nresults in a single raster that is identical to the input raster but shares the extent of the polygon clip layer.  \\nFigure 8.3 Clipping a Raster to a Vector Polygon Layer \\n \\nRaster overlays are relatively simple compared to their vector counterparts and require much less \\ncomputational power (Burroughs 1983). [1] Despite their simplicity, it is important to ensure that all \\noverlain rasters are coregistered (i.e., spatially aligned), cover identical areas, and maintain equal \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  191 \\nresolution (i.e., cell size). If these assumptions are violated, the analysis will either fail or the resulting \\noutput layer will be flawed. With this in mind, there are several different methodologies for performing a \\nraster overlay (Chrisman 2002). [2] \\nThe mathematical raster overlay is the most common overlay method. The numbers within the aligned \\ncells of the input grids can undergo any user-specified mathematical transformation. Following the \\ncalculation, an output raster is produced that contains a new value for each cell ( Figure 8.4 \"Mathematical \\nRaster Overlay\"). As you can imagine, there are many uses for such functionality. In particular, raster \\noverlay is often used in risk assessment studies where various layers are combined to produce an outcome \\nmap showing areas of high risk/reward. \\nFigure 8.4 Mathematical Raster Overlay \\n \\nTwo input raster layers are overlain to produce an output raster with summed cell values. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  192 \\nThe Boolean raster overlay method represents a second powerful technique. As discussed in Chapter 6 \\n\"Data Characteristics and Visualization\", the Boolean connectors AND, OR, and XOR can be employed to \\ncombine the information of two overlying input raster datasets into a single output raste r. Similarly, the \\nrelational raster overlay method utilizes relational operators (<, <=, =, <>, >, and =>) to evaluate \\nconditions of the input raster datasets. In both the Boolean and relational overlay methods, cells that meet \\nthe evaluation criteria are typically coded in the output raster layer with a 1, while those evaluated as false \\nreceive a value of 0. \\nThe simplicity of this methodology, however, can also lead to easily overlooked errors in interpretation if \\nthe overlay is not designed properly. Assume that a natural resource manager has two input raster \\ndatasets she plans to overlay; one showing the location of trees (\u201c0\u201d = no tree; \u201c1\u201d = tree) and one showing \\nthe location of urban areas (\u201c0\u201d = not urban; \u201c1\u201d = urban). If she hopes to find the location of trees in \\nurban areas, a simple mathematical sum of these datasets will yield a \u201c2\u201d in all pixels containing a tree in \\nan urban area. Similarly, if she hopes to find the location of all treeless (or \u201cnon-tree,\u201d nonurban areas, \\nshe can examine the summed output raster for all \u201c0\u201d entries. Finally, if she hopes to locate urban, treeless \\nareas, she will look for all cells containing a \u201c1.\u201d Unfortunately, the cell value \u201c1\u201d also is coded into each \\npixel for nonurban, tree cells. Indeed, the choice of input pixel values and overlay equation in this \\nexample will yield confounding results due to the poorly devised overlay scheme.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, line-in-polygon, or \\npolygon-in-polygon models. \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\n\u2022 Raster overlay operations can employ powerful mathematical, Boolean, or relational operators to create \\nnew output datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

New York: John Wiley and Sons. \\n8.2 Scale of Analysis \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to understand how local, neighborhood, zonal, and global analyses can be \\napplied to raster datasets. \\nRaster analyses can be undertaken on four different scales of operation: local, neighborhood, zonal, \\nand global. Each of these presents unique options to the GIS analyst and are presented here in this \\nsection. \\nLocal Operations \\nLocal operations can be performed on single or multiple rasters. When used on a single raster, a local \\noperation usually takes the form of applying some mathematical transformation to each individual cell in \\nthe grid. For example, a researcher may obtain a digital elevation model (DEM) with each cell value \\nrepresenting elevation in feet. If it is preferred to represent those elevations in meters, a simple, \\narithmetic transformation (original elevation in feet * 0.3048 = new elevation in meters) of each cell value \\ncan be performed locally to accomplish this task. \\nWhen applied to multiple rasters, it becomes possible to perform such analyses as changes over time. \\nGiven two rasters containing information on groundwater depth on a parcel of land at Year 2000 and \\nYear 2010, it is simple to subtract these values and place the difference in an output raster that will note \\nthe change in groundwater between those two times (Figure 8.5 \"Local Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nThese local analyses can become somewhat more complicated however, as the number  of input rasters \\nincrease. For example, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) applies a local mathematical formula to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  194 \\nseveral overlying rasters including rainfall intensity, erodibility of the soil, slope, cultivation type, and \\nvegetation type to determine the average soil loss (in tons) in a grid cell. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  195 \\nFigure 8.5 Local Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nNeighborhood Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  196 \\nTobler\u2019s first law of geography states that \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are \\nmore related than distant things.\u201d Neighborhood operations represent a group of frequently used spatial \\nanalysis techniques that rely heavily on this concept. Neighborhood functions examine the relationship of \\nan object with similar surrounding objects. They can be performed on point, line, or polygon vector \\ndatasets as well as on raster datasets. In the case of vector datasets, neighborhood analysis is most \\nfrequently used to perform basic searches. For example, given a point dataset co ntaining the location of \\nconvenience stores, a GIS could be employed to determine the number of stores within 5 miles of a linear \\nfeature (i.e., Interstate 10 in California). \\nNeighborhood analyses are often more sophisticated when used with raster datasets. Raster analyses \\nemploy moving windows, also called filters or kernels, to calculate new cell values for every location \\nthroughout the raster layer\u2019s extent. These moving windows can take many different forms depending on \\nthe type of output desired and the phenomena being examined. For example, a rectangular, 3-by-3 \\nmoving window is commonly used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum, maximum, \\nor range of values immediately surrounding a given \u201ctarget\u201d cell (Figure 8.6 \"Common Neighborhood \\nTypes around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). Thetarget cell is that cell \\nfound in the center of the 3-by-3 moving window. The moving window passes over every cell in the raster. \\nAs it passes each central target cell, the nine values in the 3-by-3 window are used to calculate a new value \\nfor that target cell. This new value is placed in the identical location in the output raster. If one wanted to \\nexamine a larger sphere of influence around the target cells, the moving wi ndow could be expanded to 5 \\nby 5, 7 by 7, and so forth. Additionally, the moving window need not be a simple rectangle. Other shapes \\nused to calculate neighborhood statistics include the annulus, wedge, and circle ( Figure 8.6 \"Common \\nNeighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  197 \\nFigure 8.6 Common Neighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, \\n(d) Wedge \\n \\nNeighborhood operations are commonly used for data simplification on rast er datasets. An analysis that \\naverages neighborhood values would result in a smoothed output raster with dampened highs and lows as \\nthe influence of the outlying data values are reduced by the averaging process. Alternatively, \\nneighborhood analyses can be used to exaggerate differences in a dataset. Edge enhancement is a type of \\nneighborhood analysis that examines the range of values in the moving window. A large range value \\nwould indicate that an edge occurs within the extent of the window, while a small r ange indicates the lack \\nof an edge. \\nZonal Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  198 \\nA zonal operation is employed on groups of cells of similar value or like features, not surprisingly called \\nzones (e.g., land parcels, political/municipal units, waterbodies, soil/vegetation types). Thes e zones could \\nbe conceptualized as raster versions of polygons. Zonal rasters are often created by reclassifying an input \\nraster into just a few categories (see Section 8.2.2 \"Neighborhood Operations\" ). Zonal operations may be \\napplied to a single raster or two overlaying rasters. Given a single input raster, zonal operations measure \\nthe geometry of each zone in the raster, such as area, perimeter, thickness, and centroid. Given two rasters \\nin a zonal operation, one input raster and one zonal raster, a zonal operation produces an output raster, \\nwhich summarizes the cell values in the input raster for each zone in the zonal raster ( Figure 8.7 \"Zonal \\nOperation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.7 Zonal Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nZonal operations and analyses are valuable in fields of study such as landscape ecology where the \\ngeometry and spatial arrangement of habitat patches can significantly affect the type and number of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  199 \\nspecies that can reside in them. Similarly, zonal analyses can effectively quantify the narrow habitat \\ncorridors that are important for regional movement of flightless, migratory animal species moving \\nthrough otherwise densely urbanized areas. \\nGlobal Operations \\nGlobal operations are similar to zonal operations whereby the entire raster dataset\u2019s extent represents a \\nsingle zone. Typical global operations include determining basic statistical values for the raster as a whole. \\nFor example, the minimum, maximum, average, range, and so forth can be quickly calculated over th e \\nentire extent of the input raster and subsequently be output to a raster in which every cell contains that \\ncalculated value (Figure 8.8 \"Global Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.8 Global Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  200 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Local raster operations examine only a single target cell during analysis.  \\n\u2022 Neighborhood raster operations examine the relationship of a target cell proximal surrounding cells.  \\n\u2022 Zonal raster operations examine groups of cells that occur within a uniform feature type.  \\n\u2022 Global raster operations examine the entire areal extent of the dataset.  \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to GIS surfaces, how to \\ncreate them, and how they are used to answer specific spatial questions.  \\nA surface is a vector or raster dataset that contains an attribute value for every locale throughout its \\nextent. In a sense, all raster datasets are surfaces, but not all vector datasets are surfaces. Surfaces \\nare commonly used in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize phenomena such as \\nelevation, temperature, slope, aspect, rainfall, and more. In a GIS, surface analyses are usually \\ncarried out on either raster datasets or TINs (Triangular Irregular Network; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial \\nData Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File Formats\"), but isolines or point arrays can also be \\nused. Interpolation is used to estimate the value of a variable at an unsampled location from \\nmeasurements made at nearby or neighboring locales. Spatial interpolation methods draw on the \\ntheoretical creed of Tobler\u2019s first law of geography, which states that \u201ceverything is related to \\neverything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d Indeed, this basic tenet \\nof positive spatial autocorrelation forms the backbone of many spatial analyses (Figure 8.9 \"Positive \\nand Negative Spatial Autocorrelation\"). \\nFigure 8.9 Positive and Negative Spatial Autocorrelation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  202 \\nCreating Surfaces \\nThe ability to create a surface is a valuable tool in a GIS. The creation of raster surfaces, however, often \\nstarts with the creation of a vector surface. One common method to create such a vector surface from \\npoint data is via the generation of Thiessen (or Voronoi) polygons. Thiessen polygons are mathematically \\ngenerated areas that define the sphere of influence around each point in the dataset relative to all other \\npoints (Figure 8.10 \"A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons\" ). Specifically, polygon \\nboundaries are calculated as the perpendicular bisectors of the lines between e ach pair of neighboring \\npoints. The derived Thiessen polygons can then be used as crude vector surfaces that provide attribute \\ninformation across the entire area of interest. A common example of Thiessen polygons is the creation of a \\nrainfall surface from an array of rain gauge point locations. Employing some basic reclassification \\ntechniques, these Thiessen polygons can be easily converted to equivalent raster representations.  \\nFigure 8.10 A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons \\n \\nWhile the creation of Thiessen polygons results in a polygon layer whereby each polygon, or raster zone, \\nmaintains a single value, interpolation is a potentially complex statistical technique that estimates the \\nvalue of all unknown points between the known points. The three basic methods used to create \\ninterpolated surfaces are spline, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and trend surface. The spline \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  203 \\ninterpolation method forces a smoothed curve through the set of known input points to estimate the \\nunknown, intervening values. IDW interpolation estimates the values of unknown locations using the \\ndistance to proximal, known values. The weight placed on the value of each proximal value is in inverse \\nproportion to its spatial distance from the target locale. Therefore, the farther the proximal point, the less \\nweight it carries in defining the target point\u2019s value. Finally, trend surface interpolation is the most \\ncomplex method as it fits a multivariate statistical regression model to the known points, assigning a value \\nto each unknown location based on that model. \\nOther highly complex interpolation methods exist such as kriging. Kriging is a complex geostatistical \\ntechnique, similar to IDW, that employs semivariograms to interpolate the values of an input point layer \\nand is more akin to a regression analysis (Krige 1951). [1] The specifics of the kriging methodology will not \\nbe covered here as this is beyond the scope of this text. For more information on kriging, consult review \\ntexts such as Stein (1999). [2] \\nInversely, raster data can also be used to create vector surfaces. For instance, isoline maps are made up of \\ncontinuous, nonoverlapping lines that connect points of equal value. Isolines have specific monikers \\ndepending on the type of information they model (e.g., elevation = contour lines, temperature = \\nisotherms, barometric pressure = isobars, wind speed = isotachs) Figure 8.11 \"Contour Lines Derived \\nfrom a DEM\" shows an isoline elevation map. As the elevation values of this digital elevation model \\n(DEM) range from 450 to 950 feet, the contour lines are placed at 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 feet \\nelevations throughout the extent of the image. In this example, the contour interval, defined as the vertical \\ndistance between each contour line, is 100 feet. The contour interval is determined by the user during the \\ncreating of the surface. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  204 \\nFigure 8.11 Contour Lines Derived from a DEM \\n \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Spatial interpolation is used to estimate those unknown values found between known data points.  \\n\u2022 Spatial autocorrelation is positive when mapped features are clustered and is negative when mapped \\nfeatures are uniformly distributed. \\n\u2022 Thiessen polygons are a valuable tool for converting point arrays into polygon surfaces.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to learn to apply basic raster surface analyses to terrain mapping \\napplications. \\nSurface analysis is often referred to as terrain (elevation) analysis when information related to slope, \\naspect, viewshed, hydrology, volume, and so forth are calculated on raster surfaces such as DEMs \\n(digital elevation models; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File \\nFormats\"). In addition, surface analysis techniques can also be applied to more esoteric mapping \\nefforts such as probability of tornados or concentration of infant mortalities in a given region. In this \\nsection we discuss a few methods for creating surfaces and common surface analysis techniques \\nrelated to terrain datasets. \\nSeveral common raster-based neighborhood analyses provide valuable insights into the surface \\nproperties of terrain. Slope maps (part (a) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") are excellent for analyzing and visualizing landform characteristics and are \\nfrequently used in conjunction with aspect maps (defined later) to assess watershed units, inventory \\nforest resources, determine habitat suitability, estimate slope erosion potential, and so forth. They \\nare typically created by fitting a planar surface to a 3-by-3 moving window around each target cell. \\nWhen dividing the horizontal distance across the moving window (which is determined via the \\nspatial resolution of the raster image) by the vertical distance within the window (measure as the \\ndifference between the largest cell value and the central cell value), the slope is relatively easily \\nobtained. The output raster of slope values can be calculated as either percent slope or degree of \\nslope. \\nAny cell that exhibits a slope must, by definition, be oriented in a known direction. This orientation \\nis referred to as aspect. Aspect maps (part (b) ofFigure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") use slope information to produce output raster images whereby the value of each \\ncell denotes the direction it faces. This is usually coded as either one of the eight ordinal directions \\n(north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) or in degrees from 1\u00b0 (nearly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  206 \\ndue north) to 360\u00b0 (back to due north). Flat surfaces have no aspect and are given a value of \u22121. To \\ncalculate aspect, a 3-by-3 moving window is used to find the highest and lowest elevations around \\nthe target cell. If the highest cell value is located at the top-left of the window (\u201ctop\u201d being due north) \\nand the lowest value is at the bottom-right, it can be assumed that the aspect is southeast. The \\ncombination of slope and aspect information is of great value to researchers such as botanists and \\nsoil scientists because sunlight availability varies widely between north-facing and south-facing \\nslopes. Indeed, the various light and moisture regimes resulting from aspect changes encourage \\nvegetative and edaphic differences. \\nA hillshade map (part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps\") \\nrepresents the illumination of a surface from some hypothetical, user-defined light source \\n(presumably, the sun). Indeed, the slope of a hill is relatively brightly lit when facing the sun and \\ndark when facing away. Using the surface slope, aspect, angle of incoming light, and solar altitude as \\ninputs, the hillshade process codes each cell in the output raster with an 8-bit value (0\u2013255) \\nincreasing from black to white. As you can see in part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c \\nand d) Hillshade Maps\", hillshade representations are an effective way to visualize the three-\\ndimensional nature of land elevations on a two-dimensional monitor or paper map. Hillshade maps \\ncan also be used effectively as a baseline map when overlain with a semitransparent layer, such as a \\nfalse-color digital elevation model (DEM; part (d) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  207 \\nFigure 8.12 (a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nViewshed analysis is a valuable visualization technique that uses the elevation value of cells in a DEM \\nor TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) to determine those areas that can be seen from one or more \\nspecific location(s) (part (a) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed Maps\"). The viewing \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  208 \\nlocation can be either a point or line layer and can be placed at any desired elevation. The output of \\nthe viewshed analysis is a binary raster that classifies cells as either 1 (visible) or 0 (not visible). In \\nthe case of two viewing locations, the output raster values would be 2 (visible from both points), 1 \\n(visible from one point), or 0 (not visible from either point). \\nAdditional parameters influencing the resultant viewshed map are the viewing azimuth (horizontal \\nand/or vertical) and viewing radius. The horizontal viewing azimuth is the horizontal angle of the \\nview area and is set to a default value of 360\u00b0. The user may want to change this value to 90\u00b0 if, for \\nexample, the desired viewshed included only the area that could be seen from an office window. \\nSimilarly, vertical viewing angle can be set from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. Finally, the viewing radius determines \\nthe distance from the viewing location that is to be included in the output. This parameter is \\nnormally set to infinity (functionally, this includes all areas within the DEM or TIN under \\nexamination). It may be decreased if, for instance, you only wanted to include the area within the 100 \\nkm broadcast range of a radio station. \\nSimilarly, watershed analyses are a series of surface analysis techniques that define the topographic \\ndivides that drain surface water for stream networks (part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) \\nWatershed Maps\"). In geographic information systems (GISs), a watershed analysis is based on input \\nof a \u201cfilled\u201d DEM. A filled DEM is one that contains no internal depressions (such as would be seen \\nin a pothole, sink wetland, or quarry). From these inputs, a flow direction raster is created to model \\nthe direction of water movement across the surface. From the flow direction information, a flow \\naccumulation raster calculates the number of cells that contribute flow to each cell. Generally \\nspeaking, cells with a high value of flow accumulation represent stream channels, while cells with \\nlow flow accumulation represent uplands. With this in mind, a network of rasterized stream \\nsegments is created. These stream networks are based on some user-defined minimum threshold of \\nflow accumulation. For example, it may be decided that a cell needs at least one thousand \\ncontributing cells to be considered a stream segment. Altering this threshold value will change the \\ndensity of the stream network.

This chapter is concerned less with the \\ncomputational options available to the GIS user and more with the artistic options. In essence, this \\nchapter shifts the focus away from GIS tools and toward cartographic tools, although the two are \\nbecoming more and more inextricably bound. Unfortunately, many GIS users are never exposed to \\nthe field of cartography. In these cases, the hard work of creating, maintaining, aligning, and \\nanalyzing complex spatial datasets are not truly appreciated as the final mapping product may not \\nadequately communicate this information to the consumer. In addition, maps, like statistics, can be \\nused to distort information, as illustrated by Mark Monmonier\u2019s (1996) [1] book titled How to Lie with \\nMaps. Indeed, a strong working knowledge of cartographic rules will not only assist in the avoidance \\nof potential misrepresentation of spatial information but also enhance one\u2019s ability to identify these \\nindiscretions in other cartographers\u2019 creations. The cartographic principles discussed herein are laid \\nout to guide GIS users through the process of transforming accumulated bits of GIS data into \\nattractive, useful maps for print and display. This discussion specifically addresses the intricacies of \\neffective color usage (Section 9.1 \"Color\"), symbol selection (Section 9.2 \"Symbology\"), and map \\nlayout and design (Section 9.3 \"Cartographic Design\"). \\n \\n[1] Monmonier, M. 1996.

The objective of this section is to gain an understanding the properties of color and how best to utilize \\nthem in your cartographic products. \\nAlthough a high-quality map is composed of many different elements, color is one of the first \\ncomponents noticed by end-users. This is partially due to the fact that we each have an intuitive \\nunderstanding of how colors are, and should be, used to create an effective and pleasing visual \\nexperience. Nevertheless, it is not always clear to the map-maker which colors should be used to best \\nconvey the purpose of the product. This intuition is much like listening to our favorite music. We \\nknow when a note is in tune or out of tune, but we wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any idea of how to fix a \\nbad note. Color is indeed a tricky piece of the cartographic puzzle and is not surprisingly the most \\nfrequently criticized variable on computer-generated maps (Monmonier 1996). [1] This section \\nattempts to outline the basic components of color and the guidelines to most effectively employ this \\nimportant map attribute. \\nColor Basics \\nAs electromagnetic radiation (ER) travels via waves from the sun (or a lightbulb) to objects on the earth, \\nportions of the ER spectrum are absorbed, scattered, or reflected by various objects. The resulting \\nproperty of the absorbed, scattered, and reflected ER is termed \u201ccolor.\u201d White is the color resulting from \\nthe full range of the visual spectrum and is therefore considered the benchmark color by which all others \\nare measured. Black is the absence of ER. All other colors result from a partial interaction with the ER \\nspectrum. \\nThe three primary aspects of color that must be addressed in map making are hue, value, and \\nsaturation. Hue is the dominant wavelength or color associated with a reflecting object. Hue is the most \\nbasic component of color and includes red, blue, yellow, purple, and so forth.  Value is the amount of white \\nor black in the color. Value is often synonymous with contrast. Variations in the amount of value for a \\ngiven hue result in varying degrees of lightness or darkness for that color. Lighter colors are said to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  212 \\npossess high value, while dark colors possess low value. Monochrome colors are groups of colors with the \\nsame hue but with incremental variations in value. As seen in , variations in value will typically lead the \\nviewer\u2019s eye from dark areas to light areas. \\nFigure 9.1 Value \\n \\nSaturation describes the intensity of color. Full saturation results in pure colors, while low saturation \\ncolors approach gray. Variations in saturation yield different shades and tints.  Shades are produced by \\nblocking light, such as by an umbrella, tree, curtain, and so forth. Increasing the amount of shading \\nresults in grays and blacks. Tint is the opposite of shade and is produced by adding white to a color. Tints \\nand shades are particularly germane when using additive color models (see for more on additive color \\nmodels). To maximize the interpretability of a map, use saturated colors to represent hierarchically \\nprominent features and washed-out colors to represent background features. \\nIf used properly, color can greatly enhance and support map design. Likewise, color can detract from a \\nmapping product if abused. To use color properly, one must first consider the purpose of the map. In \\nsome cases, the use of color is not warranted. Grayscale maps can be just as effective as color maps if the \\nsubject matter merits it. Regardless, there are many reasons to use color. The five primary reasons are \\noutlined here. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  213 \\nColor is particularly suited to convey meaning (). For example, red is a strong color that evokes a \\npassionate response in humans. Red has been shown to evoke physiological responses such as increasing \\nthe rate of respiration and raising blood pressure. Red is frequently associated with blood , war, violence, \\neven love. On the other hand, blue is a color associated with calming effects. Associated with the sky or \\nocean, blue colors can actually assist in sleep and is therefore a recommended color for bedrooms. Too \\nmuch blue, however, can result in a lapse from calming effects into feelings of depression (i.e., having the \\n\u201cblues\u201d). Green is most commonly associated with life or nature (plants). The color green is certainly one \\nof the most topical colors in today\u2019s society with commonplace references to green construction, the Green \\nparty, going green, and so forth. Green, however, can also represent envy and inexperience (e.g., the \\ngreen-eyed monster, greenhorn). Brown is also a nature color but more as a representation of earth and \\nstone. Brown can also imply dullness. Yellow is most commonly associated with sunshine and warmth, \\nsomewhat similar to red. Yellow can also represent cowardice (e.g., yellow -bellied). Black, the absence of \\ncolor, is possibly the most meaning-laden color in modern parlance. Even more than the others, the color \\nblack purports surprisingly strong positive and negative connotations. Black conveys mystery, elegance, \\nand sophistication (e.g., a black-tie affair, in the black), while also conveying loss, evil, and negativity (e .g., \\nblackout, black-hearted, black cloud, blacklist). \\nFigure 9.2 Use of Color to Provide Meaning \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  214 \\nIn this map, red counties are those that voted for the Republican Party in the 2004 presidential \\nelection, while blue counties voted Democrat. These colors are typically used to designate the \\nDemocratic and Republican Parties. \\nThe second reason to use color is for clarification and emphasis (). Warm colors, such as reds and yellows, \\nare notable for emphasizing spatial features. These colors will often jump of f the page and are usually the \\nfirst to attract the reader\u2019s eye, particularly if they are counterbalanced with cool colors, such as blues and \\ngreens (see for more on warm and cool colors). In addition, the use of a hue with high saturation will \\nstand out starkly against similar hues of low saturation. \\nFigure 9.3 Use of Color to Provide Emphasis \\n \\nRed marks the spot! \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  215 \\nColor use is also important for creating a map with pleasing aesthetics (). Certainly, one of the most \\nchallenging aspects of map creation is developing an effective color palette. When looking at maps \\nthrough an aesthetic lens, we are truly starting to think of our creations as artwork. Although somewhat \\nparticular to individual viewers, we all have an innate understanding of when colors in a g raphic/art are \\naesthetically pleasing and when they are not. For example, color use is considered harmonious when \\ncolors from opposite sides of the color wheel are used (), whereas equitable use of several major hues can \\ncreate an unbalanced image. \\nFigure 9.4 Use of Color to Provide Aesthetics \\n \\nThe fourth use of color is abstraction (). Color abstraction is an effective way to illustrate quantitative and \\nqualitative data, particularly for thematic products such as choropleth maps. Here, colors are used sol ely \\nto denote different values for a variable and may not have any particular rhyme or reason.  shows a typical \\nthematic map with abstract colors representing different countries.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  216 \\nFigure 9.5 Use of Color to Provide Abstraction \\n \\nOpposite abstraction, color can also be used to represent reality (). Maps showing elevation (e.g., digital \\nelevation models or DEMs) are often given false colors that approximate reality. Low areas are colored in \\nvariations of green to show areas of lush vegetation growth. Mid-elevations (or low-lying desert areas) are \\ncolored brown to show sparse vegetation growth. Mountain ridges and peaks are colored white to show \\naccumulated snowfall. Watercourses and water bodies are colored blue. Unless there is a specific reason \\nnot to, natural phenomena represented on maps should always be colored to approximate their actual \\ncolor to increase interpretability and to decrease confusion. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  217 \\nFigure 9.6 \\n3\\n \\nGreens, blues, and browns are used to imitate real-world phenomena. \\nColor Models \\nColor models are systems that allow for the creation of a range of colors from a short list of primary \\ncolors. Color models can be additive or subtractive. Additive color models combine emitted light to \\ndisplay color variations and are commonly used with computer monitors, televisions, scanners, digital \\ncameras, and video projectors. The RGB (red-green-blue) color model is the most common additive model \\n(part (a) of ). The RGB model combines light beams of the primary hues of red, green, and blue to yield \\nadditive secondary hues of magenta, cyan, and yellow. Although there is a substantive difference between \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  218 \\npure yellow light (~580 nm) and a mixture of green and red light, the human eye perceives these signals \\nas the same. The RGB model typically employs three 8-bit numeric values (called an RGB triplet) ranging \\nfrom 0 to 255 to model colors. For instance, the RGB triplets for the pure primary and secondary colors \\nare as follows: \\n\u2022 Red = (255, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 Green = (0, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Blue = (0, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Magenta = (255, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Cyan = (0, 255, 255) \\n\u2022 Yellow = (255, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Black, the absence of additive color = (0, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 White, the sum of all additive color = (255, 255, 255) \\nTwo other common additive color models, based on the RGB model, are the HSL  (hue, saturation, \\nlightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, value) models (, b and c). These models are based on cylindrical \\ncoordinate systems whereby the angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to the hue; the \\ndistance from the central axis corresponds to saturation; and the distance along the central axis \\ncorresponds to either saturation or lightness. Because of their basis in the RGB model, both the HSL and \\nHSV color models can be directly transformed between the three additive models. While these relatively \\nsimple additive models provide minimal computer-processing time, they do possess the disadvantage of \\nglossing over some of the complexities of color. For example, the RGB color model does not define \\n\u201cabsolute\u201d color spaces, which connotes that these hues may look differently when viewed on different \\ndisplays. Also, the RGB hues are not evenly spaced along the color spectrum, meaning combinations of \\nthe hues is less than exact. \\nFigure 9.7 Additive Color Models: (a) RGB, (b) HSL, and (c) HSV \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  219 \\nIn contrast to an additive model, subtractive color models involve the mixing of paints, dyes, or inks to \\ncreate full color ranges. These subtractive models display color on the assumption that white, ambient \\nlight is being scattered, absorbed, and reflected from the page by the pri nting inks. Subtractive models \\ntherefore create white by restricting ink from the print surface. As such, these models assume the use of \\nwhite paper as other paper colors will result in skewed hues. CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is the \\nmost common subtractive color model and is occasionally referred to as a \u201cfour-color process\u201d (). \\nAlthough the CMY inks are sufficient to create all of the colors of the subtractive rainbow, a black ink is \\nincluded in this model as it is much cheaper than using a CMY mix for all blacks (black being the most \\ncommonly printed color) and because combining CMY often results in more of a dark brown hue. The \\nCMYK model creates color values by entering percentages for each of the four colors ranging from 0 \\npercent to 100 percent. For example, pure red is composed of 14 percent cyan, 100 percent magenta, 99 \\npercent yellow, and 3 percent black. \\nAs you may guess, additive models are the preferred choice when maps are to be displayed on a computer \\nmonitor, while subtractive models are preferred when printing. If in doubt, it is usually best to use the \\nRGB model as this supports a larger percentage of the visible spectrum in comparison with the CMYK \\nmodel. Once an image is converted from RGB to CMYK, the additional RGB information is irretrievably \\nlost. If possible, collecting both RGB and CMYK versions of an image is ideal, particularly if your graphic \\nis to be both printed and placed online. One last note, you will also want to be selective in your use of file \\nformats for these color models. The JPEG and GIF graphic file formats are the best choice for RGB \\nimages, while the EPS and TIFF graphic file formats are preferred with printed CMYK images.  \\nFigure 9.8 Subtractive Color Model: CMYK \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  220 \\nColor Choices \\nEffective color usage requires a modicum of knowledge about the color wheel. Invented by Sir Isaac \\nNewton in 1706, the color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic \\nrelationships. Primary hues are equidistant from each other with secondary and tertiary colors \\nintervening. The red-yellow-blue color wheel is the most frequently used (); however, the magenta -yellow-\\ncyan wheel is the preferred choice of print makers (for reasons described in the previous section). Primary \\ncolors are those that cannot be created by mixing other colors; secondary colors are defined as those \\ncolors created by mixing two primary hues; tertiary colors are those created by mixing primary and \\nsecondary hues. Furthermore, complementary colors are those placed opposite each on t he wheel, while \\nanalogous colors are located proximal to each other. Complementary colors emphasize differences. \\nAnalogues suggest harmony. \\nFigure 9.9 Color Wheel Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  221 \\n \\nColors can be further referred to as warm or cool (). Warm colors are those that might be seen during a \\nbright, sunny day. Cool colors are those associated with overcast days. Warm colors are typified by hues \\nranging from red to yellow, including browns and tans. Cool color hues range from blue -green through \\nblue-violet and include the majority of gray variants. When used in mapping, it is wise to use warm and \\ncool colors with care. Indeed, warm colors stand out, appear active, and stimulate the viewer. Cool colors \\nappear small, recede, and calm the viewer. As you might guess, it is important th at you apply warm colors \\nto the map features of primary interest, while using cool colors on the secondary, background, and/or \\ncontextual features. \\nFigure 9.10 Warm (Orange) and Cool (Blue) Colors \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  222 \\n \\nNote that the warm color stands out, while the cool color recedes. \\nIn light of the plethora of color schemes and options available, it is wise to follow some basic color usage \\nguidelines. For example, changes in hue are best suited to visualizing qualitative data, while changes in \\nvalue and saturation are effective at visualizing quantitative data. Likewise, variations in lightness and \\nsaturation are best suited to representing ordered data since these establish hierarchy among features. In \\nparticular, a monochromatic color scale is an effective way to represent the order of data whereby light \\ncolors represent smaller data values and dark colors represent larger values. Keep in mind that it is best to \\nuse more light shades than dark ones as the human eye can better discern lighter shades. Also, the \\nnumber of coincident colors that can be distinguished by humans is around seven, so be careful not to \\nabuse the color palette in your maps. If the data being mapped has a zero point, a dichromatic scale () \\nprovides a natural breaking point with increasing color values on each end of the scale representing \\nincreasing data values. \\nFigure 9.11 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  223 \\n \\nA dichromatic scale is essentially two monochromatic scales joined by a low color value in the \\ncenter. \\nIn addition, darker colors result in more important or pronounced graphic featu res (assuming the \\nbackground is not overly dark). Use dark colors on features whose visual impact you wish to magnify. \\nFinally, do not use all the colors of the spectrum in a single map. It is best to leave such messy, rainbow -\\nspectacular effects to the late Jackson Pollock and his abstract expressionist ilk. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Colors are defined by their hue, value, saturation, shade, and tint. \\n\u2022 Colors are used to convey meaning, clarification and emphasis, aesthetics, abstraction, and reality.  \\n\u2022 Color models can be additive (e.g., RGB) or subtractive (e.g., CMYK). \\n\u2022 The color wheel is a powerful tool that assists in the selection of colors for your cartographic products.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how to best utilize point, line, and polygon symbols to assist \\nin the interpretation of your map and its features. \\nWhile color is an integral variable when choosing how to best represent spatial data, making \\ninformed decisions on the size, shape, and type of symbols is equally important. Although raster data \\nare restricted to symbolizing features as a single cell or as cell groupings, vector data allows for a vast \\narray of options to symbolize points, lines, and polygons in a map. Like color, cartographers must \\ntake care to use symbols judiciously in order to most effectively communicate the meaning and \\npurpose of the map to the viewer. \\nBasic Symbol Guidelines \\nVector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a myriad of ways. The guidelines laid out in this \\nsection will help you to make informed decisions on how best to represent the features in your map. The \\nprimary visual variables associated with symbolization include size, texture, pattern, and shape ( Figure \\n9.12 \"Visual Variables\"). Changes to symbol size and texture are most effectively used in conjunction with \\nordinal, interval, and ratio data. Changes to symbol pattern and shape are preferred in conjunction with \\nnominal data. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  225 \\nFigure 9.12 Visual Variables \\n \\nVariations in the size of symbols are powerful indicators of feature importance. Intuitively, larger symbols \\nare assumed to be more important than smaller symbols. Although symbol size is most commonly \\nassociated with point features, linear symbols can effectively be altered in size by adjusting line width. \\nPolygon features can also benefit from resizing. Despite the fact that the area of the polygon can\u2019t be \\nchanged, a point representing the centroid of the polygon can be included in the map. These polygon \\ncentroids can be resized and symbolized as desired, just like any other point feature. Varying symbol size \\nis moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is ineffective with nominal data.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  226 \\nSymbol texture, also referred to as spacing, refers to the compactness of the marks that make up the \\nsymbol. Points, lines, and polygons can be filled with horizontal hash marks, for instance. The closer these \\nhash marks are spaced within the feature symbol, the more hierarchically important the feature will \\nappear. Varying symbol texture is most effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is \\nineffective with nominal data. \\nMuch like texture, symbols can be filled with different patterns. These patterns are typically some artistic \\nabstraction that may or may not attempt to visualize real-world phenomena. For example, a land-use map \\nmay change the observed fill patterns of various land types to try to depict the dominant plants associated \\nwith each vegetation community. Changes to symbol patterns are most often associated with polygon \\nfeatures, although there is some limited utility in changing the fill patterns of points and lines. Varying \\nsymbol size is moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data and is ineffective when \\napplied to nominal data. \\nAltering symbol shape can have dramatic effects on the appearance of map features. Point symbols are \\nmost commonly symbolized with circles. Circles tend to be the default point symbol due to their \\nunchanging orientation, compact shape, and viewer preference. Other geometric shapes can also \\nconstitute effective symbols due to their visual stability and conservation of map space. Unless specific \\nconditions allow, volumetric symbols (spheres, cubes, etc.) should be used sparingly as they rarely \\ncontribute more than simple, two-dimensional symbols. In addition to geometric symbols, pictograms are \\nuseful representations of point features and can help to add artistic flair to a map. Pictograms should \\nclearly denote features of interest and should not require interpretation by the viewer ( Figure 9.13 \\n\"Pictograms\"). Locales that frequently employ pictograms include picnic areas, camping sites, road signs, \\nbathrooms, airports, and so forth. Varying symbol shape is most effective when applied to nominal data \\nand is moderately effective with ordinal and nominal data. \\nFinally, applying variations in lightness/darkness will affect the hierarchical value of a symbol. The darker \\nthe symbol, the more it stands out among lighter features. Variations in the lightness/darkness of a \\nsymbol are most effective when applied to ordinal data, are moderately effective when applied to \\nnumerical data, and are ineffective when applied to nominal data.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  227 \\nFigure 9.13 Pictograms \\n \\nKeep in mind that there are many other visual variables that can be employed in a map, depending on the \\ncartographic software used. Regardless of the chosen symbology, it is important to maintain a logical \\nrelationship between the symbol and the data. Also, visual contrast between different mapped variables \\nmust be preserved. Indeed, the efficacy of your map will be greatly diminished if you do not ensure that its \\nsymbols are readily identifiable and look markedly different from each other.  \\nProportional Symbolization \\nIn addition to the uniform symbols presented in the previous section, symbols for a single, q uantitative \\nvariable can be sized proportionally to match the data values. These proportional symbols are useful for \\npresenting a fairly exact understanding of the differences in magnitude within a dataset. As the numeric \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  228 \\nvalues for each class increases, so too does the size of the symbol representing that class. This allows the \\nsymbol size of features to be directly related to the attribute values they represent whereby small points \\ndenote small data values and large points denote large data values.  \\nSimilar to proportional symbols, range graded symbols group raw data into classes with each class \\nrepresented by a differently sized symbol. Both proportional and range graded symbols are most \\nfrequently used with point data, but lines and polygons can benefit from proportional symbolization as \\nwell. In the case of linear datasets, line width is most frequently used as the proportional visual variable. \\nPolygon datasets typically summarize a quantitative variable within each polygon, place a centroid within \\nthat polygon, and proportion that centroid point symbol. Range grading should not be used if the data \\nrange for a given variable is small. In these cases, range grading will suggest larger differences in the data \\nvalues than is merited. \\nThe advantage of proportional symbolization is the ease with which the viewer can discriminate symbol \\nsize and thus understand variations in the data values over a given map extent. On the other hand, \\nviewers may misjudge the magnitude of the proportional symbols if they do not pa y close attention to the \\nlegend. In addition, the human eye does not see and interpret symbol size in absolute terms. When \\nproportional circles are used in maps, it is typical that the viewer will underestimate the larger circles \\nrelative to the smaller circles. To address this potential pitfall, graduated symbols can be based on either \\nmathematical or perceptual scaling. Mathematical scaling directly relates symbol size with the data value \\nfor that locale. If one value is twice as large as another, it will be represented with a symbol twice as large \\nas the other. Perceptual scaling overcomes the underestimation of large symbols by making these symbols \\nmuch larger than their actual value would indicate (Figure 9.14 \"Mathematical versus Perceptual \\nScaling\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  229 \\nFigure 9.14 Mathematical versus Perceptual Scaling \\n \\nA disadvantage of proportional symbolization is that the symbol size can appear variable depending on \\nthe surrounding symbols. This is best shown via the Ebbinghaus illusion (also known as Titchener \\ncircles). As you can see in Figure 9.15 \"Ebbinghaus Illusion\", the central circles are both the same size but \\nappear different due to the visual influence of the surrounding circles. If you are creating a graphic with \\nmany different symbols, this illusion can wreak havoc on the interpretability of your map.  \\nFigure 9.15 Ebbinghaus Illusion \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  230 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a variety of ways.

The objective of this section is to familiarize cartographers with the basic cartographic principles that \\ncontribute to effective map design. \\nIn addition to effective use of colors and symbols, a map that is well designed will greatly enhance its \\nability to relate pertinent spatial information to the viewer. Judicious use of map elements, \\ntypography/labels, and design principles will result in maps that minimize confusion and maximize \\ninterpretability. Furthermore, the use of these components must be guided by a keen understanding \\nof the map\u2019s purpose, intended audience, topic, scale, and production/reproduction method. \\nMap Elements \\nChapter 9 \"Cartographic Principles\", Section 9.1 \"Color\" and Section 9.2 \"Symbology\" discussed visual \\nvariables specific to the spatial features of a map. However, a map is composed of many more elements \\nthan just the spatial features, each of which contributes immensely to the interpretability and flow of the \\noverall map. This section outlines the basic map elements that should be incorporated into a \u201ccomplete\u201d \\nmap. Following Slocum et al. (2005), [1] these elements are listed in the logical order in which they should \\nbe placed into the map (Figure 9.16 \"A US Map Showing Various Map Elements\"). \\nThe first feature that should be placed into the map layout is the frame line. This line is essentially a \\nbordering box that surrounds all the map elements described hereafter. All of these map elements should \\nbe balanced within the frame line. To balance a map, ensure that neither large blank spaces nor jumbled \\nmasses of information are present within the map. Similar to frame lines are  neat lines. Neat lines are \\nborder boxes that are placed around individual map elements. By definition, neat lines must occu r within \\nthe frame line. Both frame lines and neat lines are typically thin, black -lined boxes, but they can be altered \\nto match the specific aesthetics of an individual map. \\nThe mapped area is the primary geographic component of the overall map. The mapped area contains all \\nof the features and symbols used to represent the spatial phenomena being displayed. The mapped area is \\ntypically bordered with a neat line. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  232 \\nInsets can be thought of as secondary map areas, each encased within their own neat line. These  neat lines \\nshould be of different thickness or type than other line features on the map to adequately demarcate them \\nfrom other map features. Insets often display the primary mapped area in relation to a larger area. For \\nexample, if the primary map shows the locales of national parks with a county, an inset displaying the \\nlocation of that county within the larger state boundary may be included. Conversely, insets are also used \\nto display areas related to the primary map but that occur at some far off local e. This type of inset is often \\nused with maps of the United States whereby Alaska and Hawaii are placed as insets to a map of the \\ncontiguous United States. Finally, insets can be used to clarify areas where features would otherwise be \\novercrowded if restricted to the primary mapping area. If the county map of national parks contained four \\nsmall, adjacent parks, an inset could be used to expand that jumbled portion of the map to show the exact \\nspatial extent of each of the four parks. This type of inset is frequently seen when showing the small \\nnortheastern states on a map of the entire United States. \\nAll maps should have a title. The title is one of the first map elements to catch the viewer\u2019s eye, so care \\nshould be taken to most effectively represent the intent of the map with this leading text. The title should \\nclearly and concisely explain the purpose of the map and should specifically target the intended viewing \\naudience. When overly verbose or cryptically abbreviated, a poor title will detract immensely from the \\ninterpretability of the cartographic end-product. The title should contain the largest type on the map and \\nbe limited to one line, if possible. It should be placed at the top-center of the map unless there is a specific \\nreason otherwise. An alternate locale for the title is directly above the legend. \\nThe legend provides a self-explanatory definition for all symbols used within the mapped area. Care must \\nbe taken when developing this map element, as a multitude of features within a dataset can lead to an \\noverly complex legend. Although placement of the legend is variable, it should be placed within the white \\nspace of the map and not in such a way that it masks any other map elements. Atop the legend box is the \\noptional legend header. The legend header should not simply repeat the information from the title, nor \\nshould it include extraneous, non-legend-specific information. The symbols representing mapped features \\nshould be to the left of the explanatory text. Placing a neat line around the legend will help to bring \\nattention to the element and is recommended but not required. Be careful not to take up too much of the \\nmap with the legend, while also not making the legend so small that it becomes difficult to read or that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  233 \\nsymbols become cluttered. Removing information related to base map features (e.g., state boundaries on a \\nUS map) or readily identifiable features (e.g., highway or interstate symbols) is one effective way to \\nminimize legend size. If a large legend is unavoidable, it is acceptable to plac e this feature outside of the \\nmap\u2019s frame line. \\nAttribution of the data source within the map allows users to assess from where the data are derived. \\nStylistically, the data source attribution should be hierarchically minimized by using a relatively small,  \\nsimple font. It is also helpful to preface this map element with \u201cSource:\u201d to avoid confusion with other \\ntypographic elements. \\nAn indicator of scale is invaluable to provide viewers with the means to properly adjudicate the \\ndimensions of the map. While not as important when mapping large or widely familiar locales such as a \\ncountry or continent, the scale element allows viewers to measure distances on the map. The three \\nprimary representations of scale are the representational fraction, verbal scale, and b ar scale (for more, \\nsee Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.1 \"Maps and Map Types\"). The scale indicator should not be \\nprominently displayed within the map as this element is of secondary importance.  \\nFinally, map orientation notifies the viewer of the direction of the map. To assist in clarifying orientation, \\na graticule can also be included in the mapped area. Most maps are made such that the top of the page \\npoints to the north (i.e., a north-up map). If your map is not north-up, there should be a good reason for \\nit. Orientation is most often indicated with a north arrow, of which there are many stylistic options \\navailable in current geographic information system (GIS) software packages. One of the most commonly \\nencountered map errors is the use of an overly large or overly ornate north arrow. North arrows should be \\nfairly inconspicuous as they only need to be viewed once by the reader. Ornate north arrows can be used \\non small scale maps, but simple north arrows are preferred on medium to large- scale maps so as to not \\ndetract from the presumably more important information appearing elsewhere.  \\nTaken together, these map elements should work together to achieve the goal of a clear, ordered, \\nbalanced, and unified map product. Since modern GIS packages allow users to add and remove these \\ngraphic elements with little effort, care must be taken to avoid the inclination to employ these Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  234 \\ncomponents with as little forethought as it takes to create them. The following sections provide further \\nguidance on composing these elements on the page to honor and balance the mapped area.  \\nFigure 9.16 A US Map Showing Various Map Elements \\n \\nTypography and Label Placement \\nType is found throughout all the elements of a map. Type is similar to map symbols in many senses. \\nColoring effects alter typographic hierarchy as lighter type fades into the background and dark type jumps \\nto the fore. Using all uppercase letters and/or bolded letters will result in more pronounced textual \\neffects. Larger font sizes increase the hierarchical weight of the type, so ensure that the size of the type \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  235 \\ncorresponds with the importance of the map feature. Use decorative fonts, bold, and italics sparingly. \\nThese fonts, as well as overly small fonts, can be difficult to read if overused. Most importantly, always \\nspell check your final cartographic product. After spell checking, spell check again. Yu wont reegrett teh \\necstra efort. \\nOther typographic options for altering text include the use of serif, sans serif, and display fonts. While the \\nuse of serif fonts are preferred in written documents to provide horizontal guidelines, either is acceptable \\nin a mapping application (Slocum 2005). [2] Sans serif fonts, on the other hand, are preferred for maps \\nthat are viewed over the Internet. \\nKerning is an effective typographic effect that alters the space between adjacent letters in a word. \\nDecreasing the kerning of a typeset is useful if the text is too large for the space given. Alternatively, \\nincreasing the kerning is an effective way to label large map areas, par ticularly in conjunction with all-\\nuppercase lettering. Like kerning, changes in leading (pronounced \u201cled-ing\u201d) alter the vertical distance \\nbetween lines of text. Leading should not be so cramped that lines of text begin to overwrite each other, \\nnor should it be so wide that lines of text appear unrelated. Other common typographic effects include \\nmasks, callouts, shadows, and halos (Figure 9.17 \"Typographic Effects\"). All of these effects serve to \\nincrease the visibility and importance of the text to which they are applied.  \\nFigure 9.17 Typographic Effects \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  236 \\nIn addition to the general typographic guidelines discussed earlier, there are specific typographic \\nsuggestions for feature labels. Obviously, labels must be placed proximal to their symbols so they are \\ndirectly and readily associated with the features they describe. Labels should maintain a consistent \\norientation throughout so the reader does not have to rubberneck about to read various entries. Also, \\navoid overprinting labels on top of other graphics or typographic features. If that is not possible, consider \\nusing a halo, mask, callout, or shadow to help the text stand out from the background. In the case of maps \\nwith many symbols, be sure that no features intervene between a symbol and its label.  \\nSome typographic guidelines are specific to labels for point, line, and polygon features. Point labels, for \\nexample, should not employ exaggerated kerning or leading. If leader lines are used, they should not \\ntouch the point symbol nor should they include arrow heads. Leader lines should always be represented \\nwith consistent color and line thickness throughout the map extent. Lastly, point labels should be placed \\nwithin the larger polygon in which they reside. For example, if the cities of Illinois were being map ped as \\npoints atop a state polygon layer, the label for the Chicago point symbol should occur entirely over land, \\nand not reach into Lake Michigan. As this feature is located entirely on land, so should its label.  \\nLine labels should be placed above their associated features but should not touch them. If the linear \\nfeature is complex and meandering, the label should follow the general trend of the feature and not \\nattempt to match the alignment of each twist and turn. If the linear feature is particularly lon g, the feature \\ncan be labeled multiple times across its length. Line labels should always read from left to right.  \\nPolygon labels should be placed within the center of the feature whenever possible. If increased emphasis \\nis desired, all-uppercase letters can be effective. If all-uppercase letters are used, exaggerated kerning and \\nleading is also appropriate to increase the hierarchical importance of the feature. If the polygon feature is \\ntoo small to include text, label the feature as if it were a point symbol. Unlike point labels, however, leader \\nlines should just enter into the feature. \\nMap Design Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  237 \\nMap design is a complex process that provides many variables and choices to the cartographer. The \\nBritish Cartographic Society Design Group presented five \u201cPrinciples of Cartographic Design\u201d on their \\nlistserv on November 26, 1999. These principles, and a brief summary of each, are as follows:  \\n1. Concept before compilation. A basic understanding of the concept and purpose of the map \\nmust be secured before the actual mapping exercise begins. Furthermore, there is no way to \\ndetermine what information to include in a map without having first determined who the end-\\nuser is and in what manner the map will be used. A map without a purpose is of no use to anyone.  \\n2. Hierarchy with harmony. Important map features must appear prominent on the map. The \\nless important features should fade into the background. Creating harmony between the primary \\nand secondary representations on the map will lead to a quality product that will best su it the \\nneeds for which it was developed. \\n3. Simplicity from sacrifice. Upon creating a map, it is tempting to add as much information \\ninto the graphic view as can possibly fit. In reality, it is best to leave some stones unturned. Just as \\nthe key to good communication is brevity, it can be said that the key to good mapping is \\nsimplicity. A map can be considered complete when no other features can be removed. Less, in \\nthis instance, is more. \\n4. Maximum information at minimum cost. The purpose of a map is to convey the greatest \\namount of information with the least amount of interpretive effort by the user. Map design should \\nallow complex spatial relationships to be understood at a glance. \\n5. Engage the emotion to engage the understanding. Well-constructed maps are basically \\nworks of art. All of the artistic and aesthetic rules outlined in this chapter serve to engage the \\nemotive center of the viewer. If the viewer does not formulate some basic, emotional response to \\nthe map, the message will be lost. \\nIt should become increasingly clear that the cartographic choices made during the mapping process have \\nas much influence on the interpretation of a map as does the data being mapped. Borrowing liberally from \\nthe popularized Mark Twain quote, it could be said that, \u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, \\nand maps.\u201d Mapmakers, indeed, have the ability to use (or misuse) cartographic principles to represent \\n(or misrepresent) the spatial data at their disposal. It is now up to you, the cartographer, to master the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  238 \\ntools presented in this book to harness the power of maps to elucidate and address the spatial issues with \\nwhich you are confronted. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Commonly used map elements include the neat line, frame line, mapped area, inset, title, legend, data \\nsource, scale, and orientation. \\n\u2022 Like symbology, typography and labeling choices have a major impact on the interpretability of your map.  \\n\u2022 Map design is essentially an artistic endeavor based around a handful of cartographic principles. \\nKnowledge of these principles will allow you create maps worth viewing. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Go online and find a map that employs all the map elements described in this chapter.  \\n2. Go online and find two maps that violate at least two different \u201cPrinciples of Cartographic Design.\u201d \\nExplain how you would improve these maps. \\n \\n[1] Slocum, T., R. McMaster, F.

GIS users typically start their careers performing low-end tasks such as digitizing vast \\nanalogue datasets or error checking voluminous metadata files. However, adept cartographers will \\nsoon find themselves promoted through the ranks and possibly into management positions. Here, \\nthey will be tasked with an assortment of business-related activities such as overseeing work groups, \\ninterfacing with clients, creating budgets, and managing workflows. As GISs become increasingly \\ncommon in today\u2019s business world, so too must cartographers become adept at managing GIS \\nprojects to maximize effective work strategies and minimize waste. Similarly, as GIS projects begin to \\ntake on more complex and ambitious goals, GIS project managers will only become more important \\nand integral to address the upcoming challenges of the job at hand. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  240 \\n10.1 Project Management Basics \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to achieve a basic understanding of the role of a project manager in the \\nlifecycle of a GIS project. \\nProject management is a fairly recent professional endeavor that is growing rapidly to keep pace with \\nthe increasingly complex job market. Some readers may equate management with the posting of \\nclich\u00e9d artwork that lines the walls of corporate headquarters across the nation (Figure 10.1). These \\nposters often depict a multitude of parachuters falling arm-in-arm while forming some odd \\ngeometric shape, under which the poster is titled \u201cTeamwork.\u201d Another is a beautiful photo of a \\nlandscape titled, \u201cMotivation.\u201d Clearly, any job that is easy enough that its workers can be motivated \\nby a pretty picture is a job that will either soon be done by computers or shipped overseas. In reality, \\nproper project management is a complex task that requires a broad knowledge base and a variety of \\nskills. \\nFigure 10.1 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  241 \\nManagement is more than posting vapid, buzzword-laden artwork such as this in the office \\nplace. \\nThe Project Management Institute (PMI) Standards Committee describes project management as \\n\u201cthe application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet or \\nexceed stakeholder needs and expectations.\u201d To assist in the understanding and implementation of \\nproject management, PMI has written a book devoted to this subject titled, \u201cA Guide to the Project \\nManagement Body of Knowledge,\u201d also known as the PMBOK Guide (PMI 2008). This section guides \\nthe reader through the basic tenets of this text. \\nThe primary stakeholders in a given project include the project manager, project team, sponsor/client, \\nand customer/end-user. As project manager, you will be required to identify and solve potential \\nproblems, issues, and questions as they arise. Although much of this section is applicable to the \\nmajority of information technology (IT) projects, GIS projects are particularly challenging due to the \\nlarge storage, integration, and performance requirements associated with this particular field. GIS \\nprojects, therefore, tend to have elevated levels of risk compared to standard IT projects. \\nProject management is an integrative effort whereby all of the project\u2019s pieces must be aligned \\nproperly for timely completion of the work. Failure anywhere along the project timeline will result in \\ndelay, or outright failure, of the project goals. To accomplish this daunting task, \\nfive process groups and nine project management knowledge areas have been developed to meet \\nproject objectives. These process groups and knowledge areas are described in this section. \\nPMBOK Process Groups \\nThe five project management process groups presented here are described separately, but realize that \\nthere is typically a large degree of overlap among each of them.  \\nInitiation, the first process group, defines and authorizes a particular project o r project phase. This is the \\npoint at which the scope, available resources, deliverables, schedule, and goals are decided. Initiation is \\ntypically out of the hands of the project management team and, as such, requires a high -level \\nsponsor/client to approve a given course of action. This approval comes to the project manager in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  242 \\nform of a project charter that provides the authority to utilize organizational resources to address the \\nissues at hand. \\nThe planning process group determines how a newly initiated project phase will be carried out. It focuses \\non defining the project scope, gathering information, reviewing available resources, identifying and \\nanalyzing potential risks, developing a management plan, and estimating timetables and costs. As such, \\nall stakeholders should be involved in the planning process group to ensure comprehensive feedback. The \\nplanning process is also iterative, meaning that each planning step may positively or negatively affect \\nprevious decisions. If changes need to be made during these iterations, the project manager must revisit \\nthe plan components and update those now-obsolete activities. This iterative methodology is referred to \\nas \u201crolling wave planning.\u201d \\nThe executing process group describes those processes employed to compl ete the work outlined in the \\nplanning process group. Common activities performed during this process group include directing project \\nexecution, acquiring and developing the project team, performing quality assurance, and distributing \\ninformation to the stakeholders. The executing process group, like the planning process group, is often \\niterative due to fluctuations in project specifics (e.g., timelines, productivity, unanticipated risk) and \\ntherefore may require reevaluation throughout the lifecycle of the project. \\nThe monitoring and controlling process group is used to observe the project, identify potential problems, \\nand correct those problems. These processes run concurrently with all of the other process groups and \\ntherefore span the entire project lifecycle. This process group examines all proposed changes to the \\nproject and approves only those that do not alter the overall, stated goals of the project. Some of the \\nspecific activities and actions monitored and controlled by this process group include the  project scope, \\nschedule, cost, output quality, reports, risk, and stakeholder interactions.  \\nFinally, the closing process group essentially terminates all of the actions and activities undertaken during \\nthe four previous process groups. This process group includes handing off all pertinent deliverables to the \\nproper recipients and the formal completion of all contracts with the sponsor/client. This process group is \\nalso important to signal the sponsor/client that no more charges will be made, and they can n ow reassign \\nthe project staff and organizational resources as needed. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  243 \\nPMBOK Project Management Knowledge Areas \\nEach of the five aforementioned process groups is available for use with nine different knowledge areas. \\nThese knowledge areas comprise those subjects that project managers must be familiar with to \\nsuccessfully complete a given project. A brief description of each of these nine knowledge areas is \\nprovided here. \\n1. Project integration management describes the ability of the project manager to \u201cidentify, \\ndefine, combine, unify, and coordinate\u201d the various project activities into a coherent whole \\n(PMBOK 2008). It is understood by senior project managers that there is no single way to \\nsuccessfully complete this task. In reality, each manager must apply their specific skills, \\ntechniques, and knowledge to the job at hand. This knowledge area incorporates all five of the \\nPMBOK process groups. \\n2. Project scope management entails an understanding of not only what work is required to \\ncomplete the project but also what extraneous work should be excluded from project. Defining the \\nscope of a project is usually done via the creation of a scope plan document that is distributed \\namong team members. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n3. Project time management takes into account the fact that all projects are subject to certain \\ntime constraints. These time constraints must be analyzed and an overall pr oject schedule must \\nbe developed based on inputs from all project stakeholders (see Section 10.2.1 \"Scheduling\"  for \\nmore on scheduling). This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n4. Project cost management is focused not only with determining a reasonable budget for each \\nproject task but also with staying within the defined budget. Project cost management is often \\neither very simple or very complex. Particular care needs to be taken to work with th e \\nsponsor/client as they will be funding this effort. Therefore, any changes or augments to the \\nproject costs must be vetted through the sponsor/client prior to initiating those changes. This \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring and controlling process \\ngroups. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  244 \\n5. Project quality management identifies the quality standards of the project and determines \\nhow best to satisfy those standards. It incorporates responsibilities such as quality planning, \\nquality assurance, and quality control. To ensure adequate quality management, the project \\nmanager must evaluate the expectations of the other stakeholders and continually monitor the \\noutput of the various project tasks. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n6. Project human resource management involves the acquisition, development, organization, \\nand oversight of all team members. Managers should attempt to include team members in as \\nmany aspects of the task as possible so they feel loyal to the work and invested in creating the best \\noutput possible. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and \\ncontrolling process groups. \\n7. Project communication management describes those processes required to maintain open \\nlines of communication with the project stakeholders. Included in this knowledge area is the \\ndetermination of who needs to communicate with whom, how communication will be maintained \\n(e-mail, letter reports, phone, etc.), how frequently contacts will be made, what barriers will limit \\ncommunication, and how past communications will be tracked and archived. This knowledge area \\nincorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling process groups.  \\n8. Project risk management identifies and mitigates risk to the project. It is concerned with \\nanalyzing the severity of risk, planning responses, and monitoring those identified risks. Risk \\nanalysis has become a complex undertaking as experienced project managers understand that \u201can \\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d Risk management involves working with all team \\nmembers to evaluate each individual task and to minimize the potential for that risk to manifest \\nitself in the project or deliverable. This knowledge area incorporates the plann ing, as well as the \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n9. Project procurement management, the final knowledge area, outlines the process by which \\nproducts, services, and/or results are acquired from outside the project team. This includes \\nselecting business partners, managing contracts, and closing contracts. These contracts are legal \\ndocuments supported by the force of law. Therefore, the fine print must be read and understood \\nto ensure that no confusion arises between the two parties entering into th e agreement. This Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  245 \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing \\nprocess groups. \\nProject Failure \\nMurphy\u2019s Law of Project Management states that no major project is completed on time, within budget, \\nand with the same staff that started it\u2014 do not expect yours to be the first. It has been estimated that only \\n16 percent of fully implemented information technology projects are completed on time and within budget \\n(The Standish Group International 2000). [1] These failed projects result in an estimated loss of over $81 \\nbillion every year! David Hamil discusses the reasons for these failures in his web feature titled, \u201cYour \\nMission, Should You Choose to Accept It: Project Management Excellence\u201d \\n(http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/features/mesa1). \\nThe first noted cause for project failure is poor planning. Every project must undergo some type of \\nplanning-level feasibility study to determine the purpose of the project and the methodologies employed \\nto complete it. A feasibility study is basically used to determine whether or not a project should be given \\nthe \u201cgreen light.\u201d It outlines the project mission, goals, objectives, scope, and constraints. A project may \\nbe deemed unfeasible for a variety of reasons including an unacceptable level of risk, unclear project \\nrequirements, disagreement among clients regarding project objectives, missing key stakeholders, and \\nunresolved political issues. \\nA second cause for project failure is lack of corporate management support. Inadequate staffing and \\nfunding, as well as weak executive sponsorship on the part of the client, will typically result in a project \\nwith little chance of success. One of the most important steps in managing a project will be to determine \\nwhich member of the client\u2019s team is championing your project. This individual, or group of individuals, \\nmust be kept abreast of all major decisions related to the project. If the client\u2019s project champion loses \\ninterest in or contact with the effort, failure is not far afield. \\nA third common cause of project failure is poor project management. A high -level project manager should \\nhave ample experience, education, and leadership abilities, in addition to being a skilled negotiator, \\ncommunicator, problem solver, planner, and organizer. Despite the fact that managers with this wide -Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  246 \\nranging expertise are both uncommon and expensive to maintain, it only takes a failed project or two for a \\nclient to learn the importance of securing the proper person for the job at hand.  \\nThe final cause of project failure is a lack of client focus and the lack of the end -user participation. The \\nclient must be involved in all stages of the lifecycle of the project. More than on e GIS project has been \\ncompleted and delivered to the client, only to discover that the final product was neither what the client \\nenvisioned nor what the client wanted. Likewise, the end-user, which may or may not be the client, is the \\nmost important participant in the long-term survival of the project. The end-user must participate in all \\nstages of project development. The creation of a wonderful GIS tool will most likely go unused if the end -\\nuser can find a better and/or more cost-efficient solution to their needs elsewhere. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Project managers must employ a wide range of activities and actions to achieve the overall goals of the \\nproject. These actions are broken down into five process groups: initiation, planning, executing, \\nmonitoring and controlling, and closing. \\n\u2022 The activities and actions described in this section are applied to nine management knowledge areas that \\nmanagers must be cognizant of to ensure that all the goals of the project will be met: integration \\nmanagement, scope management, time management, cost management, quality management, human \\nresource management, communication management, risk management, and procurement management.  \\n\u2022 Projects can fail for a variety of reasons. Successful managers will be aware of these potential pitfal ls and \\nwill work to overcome them. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. As a student, you are constantly tasked with completing assignments for your classes. Think of one of \\nyour recent assignments as a project that you, as a project (assignment) manager, completed. Describe \\nhow you utilized a sampling of the project management process groups and knowledge areas to complete \\nthat assigned task. \\n \\n[1] The Standish Group International. 2000. \u201cOur Blog.\u201d http://www.pm2go.com. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  247 \\n10.2 GIS Project Management Tools and Techniques \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review a sampling of the common tools and techniques available to \\ncomplete GIS project management tasks. \\nAs a project manager, you will find that there are many tools and techniques that will assist your \\nefforts. While some of these are packaged in a geographic information system (GIS), many are not. \\nOthers are mere concepts that managers must be mindful of when overseeing large projects with a \\nmultitude of tasks, team members, clients, and end-users. This section outlines a sampling of these \\ntools and techniques, although their implementation is dependent on the individual project, scope, \\nand requirements that arise therein. Although these topics could be sprinkled throughout the \\npreceding chapters, they are not concepts whose mastery is typically required of entry-level GIS \\nanalysts or technicians. Rather, they constitute a suite of skills and techniques that are often applied \\nto a project after the basic GIS work has been completed. In this sense, this section is used as a \\nplatform on which to present novice GIS users with a sense of future pathways they may be led down, \\nas well as providing hints to other potential areas of study that will complement their nascent GIS \\nknowledge base. \\nScheduling \\nOne of the most difficult and dread-inducing components of project management for many is the need to \\noversee a large and diverse group of team members. While this text does not cover tips for getting along \\nwith others, ensuring that each project member is on task and up to date is an excellent way to reduce \\npotential problems associated with a complex project. To achieve this, there are several tools available to \\ntrack project schedules and goal completions. \\nThe Gantt chart (named after its creator, Henry Gantt) is a bar chart that is used specifically for tracking \\ntasks throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, Gantt charts show the dependencies of interrelated \\ntasks and focus on the start and completion dates for each specific task. Gantt charts will typically \\nrepresent the estimated task completion time in one color and the actual time to completion in a second Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  248 \\ncolor (Figure 10.2 \"Gantt Chart\"). This color coding allows project members to rapidly assess the project \\nprogress and identify areas of concern in a timely fashion. \\nFigure 10.2 Gantt Chart \\n \\nPERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts are similar to Gantt charts in that they are both \\nused to coordinate task completion for a given project (Figure 10.3 \"PERT Chart\"). PERT charts focus \\nmore on the events of a project than on the start and completion dates as seen with the Gantt charts. This \\nmethodology is more often used with very large projects where adherence to strict time guidelines is more \\nimportant than monetary considerations. PERT charts include the identification of the project\u2019s critical \\npath. After estimating the best- and worst-case scenario regarding the time to finish all tasks, the critical \\npath outlines the sequence of events that results in the longest potential duration for the project. Delays to \\nany of the critical path tasks will result in a net delay to project completion and therefore  must be closely \\nmonitored by the project manager. \\nFigure 10.3 PERT Chart \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  249 \\n \\nThere are some advantages and disadvantages to both the Gantt and PERT chart types. Gantt charts are \\npreferred when working with small, linear projects (with less than thirty or so  tasks, each of which occurs \\nsequentially). Larger projects (1) will not fit onto a single Gantt display, making them more difficult to \\nvisualize, and (2) quickly become too complex for the information therein to be related effectively. Gantt \\ncharts can also be problematic because they require a strong sense of the entire project\u2019s timing before the \\nfirst task has even been committed to the page. Also, Gantt charts don\u2019t take correlations between \\nseparate tasks into account. Finally, any change to the scheduling of the tasks in a Gantt chart results in \\nhaving to recreate the entire schedule, which can be a time-consuming and mind-numbing experience. \\nPERT charts also suffer from some drawbacks. For example, the time to completion for each individual \\ntask is not as clear as it is with the Gantt chart. Also, large project can become very complex and span \\nmultiple pages. Because neither method is perfect, project managers will often use Gantt and PERT charts \\nsimultaneously to incorporate the benefits of each methodology into their project. \\nWorking with CAD Data \\nWhile a GIS commands a large swath of the computer-generated mapping market share, it is not the only \\ncartographic player in town. GIS, as you now hopefully understand, is primarily a database -driven \\nmapping solution. Computer-aided design (CAD), on the other hand, is a graphics-based mapping \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  250 \\nsolution adopted by many cartographers; engineers in particular. Historically speaking, points, lines, and \\npolygons in a CAD system do not link to attributes but are mere drawings representing some reality. CAD \\nsoftware, however, has recently begun to incorporate \u201csmart\u201d features whereby attribute information is \\nexplicitly linked to the spatial representations. \\nCAD is typically used on many projects related to surveying and civil engineering work. For example, \\ncreating a cadastral map for a housing development is a complex matter with a fine scale of exactitude \\nrequired to ensure, for example, that all electrical, sewer, transportation, and gas lines meet at precise \\nlocales (Figure 10.4 \"CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project\"). An error of inches, in \\neither the vertical or horizontal dimension, could result in a need for a major plan redesign that may cost \\nthe client an inordinate amount of time and money. Too many of these types of errors, and you and your \\nengineer may soon be looking for a new job. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  251 \\nFigure 10.4 CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project \\n \\nRegardless, the CAD drawing used to create these development plans is usually only concerned with the \\nlocal information in and around the project site that directly affects the construction of the housing units, \\nsuch as local elevation, soil/substrates, land-use/land-cover types, surface water flows, and groundwater \\nresources. Therefore, local coordinate systems are typically employed by the civil engineer whereby the \\norigin coordinate (the 0, 0 point) is based off of some nearby landmark such as a manhole, fire hydrant, \\nstake, or some other survey control point. While this is acceptable for engineers, the GIS user typically is \\nconcerned not only with local phenomena but also with tying the project into a larger world.  \\nFor example, if a development project impacts a natural watercourse in the state of California, agencies \\nsuch as the US Army Corps of Engineers (a nationwide government agency), California Department of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  252 \\nFish and Game (a statewide government agency), and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (a local \\ngovernment agency) will each exert some regulatory requirements over the d eveloper. These agencies will \\nwant to know where the watercourse originates, where it flows to, where within the length of the \\nwatercourse the development project occurs, and what percentage of the watercourse will be impacted. \\nThese concerns can only be addressed by looking at the project in the larger context of the surrounding \\nwatershed(s) within which the project occurs. To accomplish this, external, standardized GIS datasets \\nmust be brought to bear on the project (e.g., national river reaches, stream f low and rain gauges, habitat \\nmaps, national soil surveys, and regional land-use/land-cover maps). These datasets will normally be \\ngeoreferenced to some global standard and therefore will not automatically overlay with the engineer\u2019s \\nlocal CAD data. \\nAs project manager, it will be your team\u2019s duty to import the CAD data (typically DWG, DGN, or DXF file \\nformat) and align it exactly with the other, georeferenced GIS data layers. While this has not been an easy \\ntask historically, sophisticated tools are being developed by both CAD and GIS software packages to \\nensure that they \u201cplay nicely\u201d with each other. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package contains a \\n\u201cGeoreferencing\u201d toolbar that allows users to shift, pan, resize, rotate, and add control points to assist in \\nthe realignment of CAD data. \\nApplication Development \\nAs project manager, you may discover that the GIS software package employed by your workgroup is \\nmissing some basic functionality that would greatly enhance the productivity of your team. In these cases, \\nit may be worthwhile to create your own GIS application(s). GIS applications are either stand -alone GIS \\nsoftware packages or customizations of a preexisting GIS software package that are made to meet some \\nspecific project need. These applications can range from simple (e.g., apply a standard symbol/color set \\nand text guidelines to mapped features) to complex (e.g., sort layers, select features based on a predefined \\nset of rules, perform a spatial analysis, and output a hard-copy map). \\nSome of the more simple applications can be created by using the canned tool sets and functionality \\nprovided in the GIS software. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package includes a macro language \\ncalled Model Builder that allows users with no knowledge of programming  languages create a series of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  253 \\nautomated tasks, also called workflows, which can be chained together and executed multiple times to \\nreduce the redundancy associated with many types of GIS analyses. The more complex applications will \\nmost likely require the use of the GIS software\u2019s native macro language or to write original code using \\nsome compatible programming language. To return to the example of ESRI products, ArcGIS provides the \\nability to develop and incorporate user-written programs, called scripts, into to standard platform. These \\nscripts can be written in the Python, VBScript, JScript, and Perl programming languages.  \\nWhile you may want to create a GIS application from the ground up to meet your project needs, there are \\nmany that have already been developed. These pre-written applications, many of which are open source, \\nmay be employed by your project team to reduce the time, money, and headache associated with such an \\neffort.

Many of them incorporate open -source \\nshared libraries that perform functions such as format support, geoprocessing, and reprojection of \\ncoordinate systems. A sampling of these libraries is as follows: \\n1.

For example, Java has been used to develop \\nunique applications (e.g., gvSIG, OpenMap, uDig, Geoserver, JUMP, and DeeGree) from its l ibraries \\n(GeoAPI, WKB4J, GeoTools, and JTS Topology Suite), while .Net applications (e.g., MapWindow, \\nWorldWind, SharpMap) are a new but powerful application option that support their own libraries \\n(Proj.Net, NTS) as well as the C-based libraries. \\nMap Series \\nA project manager will often be required to produce paper and/or digital maps of the project site. These \\nmaps will typically include standard information such as a title, north arrow, scale bar, corporate contact \\ninformation, data source, and so forth. This is simple if the site is small enough that the pertinent mapped \\nfeatures can be resolved on a single map. However, problems arise if the site is exceedingly large, follows a \\nlinear pathway (e.g., highway improvement projects), or is composed of distant, noncontiguous site Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  255 \\nlocales. In these cases, the manager will need to create a series of easily referenced and reproduced maps \\nthat are at the exact same scale, have minimal overlap, and maintain consistent collar material \\nthroughout. \\nTo accomplish this task, a map series can be employed to create standar dized maps from the GIS (e.g., \\n\u201cDS Map Book\u201d for ArcGIS 9; \u201cData Driven Pages\u201d for ArcGIS 10). A map series is essentially a multipage \\ndocument created by dividing the overall data frame into unique tiles based on a user -\\ndefinedindex grid. Figure 10.5 \"Project Site Tiled into an Output Series\" shows an example of a map series \\nthat divides a project site into a grid of similar tiles. Figure 10.6 \"Output from a Map Series\"  shows the \\nstandardized maps produced when that series is printed. While these maps can certainly be created \\nwithout the use of a map series generator, this functionality greatly assists in the organization and display \\nof project\u2019s whose extents cannot be represented within a single map. \\nFigure 10.5 Project Site Tiled into an Output Series \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  256 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nFigure 10.6 Output from a Map Series \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nGrid-to-Ground Transformations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  257 \\nProject managers must be mindful of the transition from in-program mapped units to real-world \\nlocations. As discussed in Chapter 3 \"Data, Information, and Where to Find Them\", Section 3.2 \"Data \\nabout Data\", transforming the three-dimensional earth to two dimensions necessarily results in both \\naccuracy and precision errors. While projects that cover a small areal extent may not noticeably suffer \\nfrom this error, projects that cover a large areal extent could run into substantial problems. \\nWhen surveyors measure the angles and distances of features on the earth for input into a GIS, they are \\ntaking \u201cground\u201d measurements. However, spatial datasets in a GIS are based on a predefined coordinate \\nsystem, referred to as \u201cgrid\u201d measurements. In the case of angles, ground measurements are taken relative \\nto some north standard such as true north, grid north, or magnetic north. Grid measurements are always \\nrelative to the coordinate system\u2019s grid north. Therefore, grid north and ground north may well need to be \\nrotated in order to align correctly. \\nIn the case of distances, two sources of error may be present: (1) scale error and (2) elevation error. Scale \\nerror refers to the phenomenon whereby points measured on the three-dimensional earth (i.e., ground \\nmeasurement) must first be translated onto the coordinate system\u2019s ellipsoid (i.e., mean sea level), and \\nthen must be translated to the two-dimensional grid plane (Figure 10.7 \"Grid-to-Ground \\nTransformation\"). Basically, scale error is associated with the move from three to two dimensions and is \\nremedied by applying a scale factor (SF) to any measurements made to the dataset.  \\nFigure 10.7 Grid-to-Ground Transformation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  258 \\nIn addition to scale error, elevation error becomes increasingly pronounced as the project site\u2019s elevation \\nbegins to rise. Consider Figure 10.8 \"Grid versus Ground Measurements\", where a line measured as 1,000 \\nfeet at altitude must first be scaled down to fit the earth\u2019s ellipsoid measurement, then scaled again to fit \\nthe coordinate system\u2019s grid plane. Each such transition requires compensation, referred to as the \\nelevation factor (EF). The SF and EF are often combined into a single combination factor (CF) that is \\nautomatically applied to any measurements taken from the GIS. \\nFigure 10.8 Grid versus Ground Measurements \\n \\nIn addition to EF and SF errors, care must be taken when surveying areas greater than 5 miles in length. \\nAt these distances, slight errors will begin to compound and may create noticeable discrepancies. In \\nparticular, projects whose length crosses over coordinate systems zones (e.g., Universal Transverse \\nMercator [UTM] zones or State Plane zones) are likely to suffer from unacceptable grid -to-ground errors. \\nWhile the tools and techniques outlined in this section may be considered beyond the scope of an \\nintroductory text on GISs, these pages represent some of the concerns that will arise during your tenure as \\na GIS project manager. Although you will not need a comprehensive underst anding of these issues for \\nyour first GIS-related jobs, it is important that you understand that becoming a competent GIS user will \\nrequire a wide-ranging skill set, both technically and interpersonally. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  259 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 As project manager, you will need to utilize a wide variety of tools and techniques to complete your GIS \\nproject. \\n\u2022 The tools and techniques you employ will not necessarily be included as a part of your native GIS software \\npackage. In these cases, you will need to apply all project management r esources at your disposal. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. Consider the following GIS project: You are contacted by the City of Miami to determine the effect of \\ninundation due to sea-level rise on municipal properties over the next hundred years.

Assuming you have two months to complete this task, develop a timeline that \\nshows the steps you would take to respond to the city\u2019s request. In your discussion, include information \\npertaining to the data layers (both raster and vector), data sources, and data attributes needed to address \\nthe problem. Outline some of the geoprocessing steps that would be required to convert your baseline \\nGIS data into project-specific layers that would address this particular problem. Upon completion of the \\ngeospatial analysis, how might you employ cartographic principals to most effectively present the data to \\ncity officials? Talk about potential problems that may arise during the analysis and discuss how you might \\ngo about addressing these issues. \\n \\n[1] Ramsey, P. 2007. \u201cThe State of Open Source GIS.\u201d Refractions \\nResearch.http://www.refractions.net/expertise/whitepapers/opensourcesurvey/survey -open-source-2007-12.pdf. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ', 'Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  1 \\nThis text was adapted by The Saylor Foundation under a Creative \\nCommons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License without \\nattribution as requested by the work\u2019s original creator or licensee. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  2 \\nPreface \\nMaps are everywhere\u2014 on the Internet, in your car, and even on your mobile phone. Moreover, maps \\nof the twenty-first century are not just paper diagrams folded like an accordion. Maps today are \\ncolorful, searchable, interactive, and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and \\ninteractive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of \\ngeographic data. The key technology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the \\ntwenty-first century, is geographic information systems or GIS. \\nPut simply, GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from \\nvarious sources as maps. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of \u201cwhere\u201d has \\ntaken on new meaning. From getting directions to a new restaurant in San Francisco on your mobile \\ndevice to exploring what will happen to coastal cities like Venice if oceans were to rise due to global \\nwarming, GIS provides insights into daily tasks and the big challenges of the future. \\nEssentials of Geographic Information Systems integrates key concepts behind the technology with \\npractical concerns and real-world applications. Recognizing that many potential GIS users are \\nnonspecialists or may only need a few maps, this book is designed to be accessible, pragmatic, and \\nconcise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask \\nquestions, inform choices, and guide policy. From the melting of the polar ice caps to privacy issues \\nassociated with mapping, this book provides a gentle, yet substantive, introduction to the use and \\napplication of digital maps, mapping, and GIS. \\nIn today\\'s world, learning involves knowing how and where to search for information. In some \\nrespects, knowing where to look for answers and information is arguably just as important as the \\nknowledge itself. Because Essentials of Geographic Information Systems is concise, focused, and \\ndirected, readers are encouraged to search for supplementary information and to follow up on \\nspecific topics of interest on their own when necessary. Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems provides the foundations for learning GIS, but readers are encouraged to construct their \\nown individual frameworks of GIS knowledge. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. First, it Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  3 \\npromotes active learning through research. Second, it facilitates flexible and selective learning\u2014 that \\nis, what is learned is a function of individual needs and interest. \\nSince GIS and related geospatial and navigation technology change so rapidly, a flexible and dynamic \\ntext is necessary in order to stay current and relevant. Though essential concepts in GIS tend to \\nremain constant, the situations, applications, and examples of GIS are fluid and dynamic. Though \\nthis book is intended for use in introductory GIS courses, Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems will also appeal to the large number of certificate, professional, extension, and online \\nprograms in GIS that are available today. In addition to providing readers with the tools necessary to \\ncarry out spatial analyses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems outlines valuable \\ncartographic guidelines for maximizing the visual impact of your maps. The book also describes \\neffective GIS project management solutions that commonly arise in the modern workplace.

Knowing something about where something happens can \\nhelp us to understand what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and why it happened. \\nWhether it is an outbreak of a highly contagious disease, the discovery of a new frog species, the path of a \\ndeadly tornado, or the nearest location of a supermarket, knowing something about where things happen \\nis important to how we understand and relate to our local environment and to the world at large.  \\nA geographic information system\u2014 or GIS\u2014 is a special type of information technology that can help us \\nunderstand and relate to the \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the world by answering \u201cwhere.\u201d \\nGeographic information systems are indeed about maps, but they are also about much, much more.  \\nA GIS is used to organize, analyze, visualize, and share all kinds of data and information from different \\nhistorical periods and at various scales of analysis. From climatologists trying to understand the causes \\nand consequences of global warming, to epidemiologists locating ground zero of a virulent disease \\noutbreak, to archaeologists reconstructing ancient Rome, to political consultants developing campaign \\nstrategies for the next presidential election, GIS is a very powerful tool.  \\nMore important, GIS is about geography and learning about the world in which we live. As GIS techno logy \\ndevelops, as society becomes ever more geospatially enabled, and as more and more people rediscover \\ngeography and the power of maps, the future uses and applications of GIS are unlimited.  \\nTo take full advantage of the benefits of GIS and related geospatial technology both now and in the future, \\nit is useful to take stock of the ways in which we already think spatially with respect to the world in which \\nwe live. In other words, by recognizing and increasing our geographical awareness about how we relate  to \\nour local environment and the world at large, we will benefit more from our use and application of GIS.  \\nThe purpose of this chapter is to increase our geographical awareness and to refine our spatial thinking. \\nFirst, a simple mental mapping exercise is used to highlight our geographical knowledge and spatial \\nawareness, or lack thereof. Second, fundamental concepts and terms that are central to geographic \\ninformation systems, and more generally geography, are identified, defined, and explained. This chap ter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  5 \\nconcludes with a description of the frameworks that guide the use and application of GIS, as well as its \\nfuture development. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  6 \\n1.1 Spatial Thinking \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to illustrate how we think geographically every day with mental maps and \\nto highlight the importance of asking geographic questions. \\nAt no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to create or to acquire a map of nearly \\nanything. Maps and mapping technology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the modes \\nand means of making and distributing maps have been revolutionized with recent advances in \\ncomputing like the Internet, the art and science of map making date back centuries. This is because \\nhumans are inherently spatial organisms, and in order for us to live in the world, we must first \\nsomehow relate to it. Enter the mental map. \\nMental Maps \\nMental or cognitive maps are psychological tools that we all use every day. As the name \\nsuggests, mental maps are maps of our environment that are stored in our brain. We rely on our mental \\nmaps to get from one place to another, to plan our daily activities, or to understand and situate events that \\nwe hear about from our friends, family, or the news. Mental maps also reflect the amount and ex tent of \\ngeographic knowledge and spatial awareness that we possess. To illustrate this point, pretend that a friend \\nis visiting you from out of town for the first time. Using a blank sheet of paper, take five to ten minutes to \\ndraw a map from memory of your hometown that will help your friend get around. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  7 \\n \\nWhat did you choose to draw on your map? Is your house or where you work on the map? What about \\nstreets, restaurants, malls, museums, or other points of interest? How did you draw objects on your map? \\nDid you use symbols, lines, and shapes? Are places labeled? Why did you choose to include certain places \\nand features on your map but not others? What limitations did you encounter when making your map?  \\nThis simple exercise is instructive for several reasons. First, it illustrates what you know about where you \\nlive. Your simple map is a rough approximation of your local geographic knowledge and mental map. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  8 \\nSecond, it highlights the way in which you relate to your local environment. What you choose to include \\nand exclude on your map provides insights about what places you think are important and how you move \\nthrough your place or residence. Third, if we were to compare your mental map to someone else\u2019s from \\nthe same place, certain similarities emerge that shed light upon how we as humans tend to think spatially \\nand organize geographical information in our minds. Fourth, this exercise reveals something about your \\nartistic, creative, and cartographic abilities. In this respect, not only are mental maps unique, but also the \\nway in which such maps are drawn or represented on the page is unique too.  \\nTo reinforce these points, consider the series of mental maps of Los Angeles provided in Figure 1.1 \\n\"Mental Map of Los Angeles A\". \\nFigure 1.1 Mental Map of Los Angeles A \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  9 \\nFigure 1.2 Mental Map of Los Angeles B \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  10 \\nFigure 1.3 Mental Map of Los Angeles C \\n \\nTake a moment to look at each map and compare the maps with the following questions in mind:  \\n\u2022 What similarities are there on each map? \\n\u2022 What are some of the differences? \\n\u2022 Which places or features are illustrated on the map? \\n\u2022 From what you know about Los Angeles, what is included or excluded on the maps? \\n\u2022 What assumptions are made in each map? \\n\u2022 At what scale is the map drawn? \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  11 \\nEach map is probably an imperfect representation of one\u2019s mental map, but we can see some similarities \\nand differences that provide insights into how people relate to Los Angeles, maps, and more generally, the \\nworld. First, all maps are oriented so that north is up. Though only one of the maps contains a north \\narrow that explicitly informs viewers the geographic orientation of the map, we are accustomed to most \\nmaps having north at the top of the page. Second, all but the first map identify some prominent features \\nand landmarks in the Los Angeles area. For instance, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) appears on \\ntwo of these maps, as do the Santa Monica Mountains. How the airport is represented or portrayed on the \\nmap, for instance, as text, an abbreviation, or symbol, also speaks to our experience using and \\nunderstanding maps. Third, two of the maps depict a portion of the freeway network in Los Angeles, and \\none also highlights the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek. In a city where the \u201ccar is king,\u201d how can any \\nmap omit the freeways? \\nWhat you include and omit on your map, by choice or not, speaks volumes about your geographical \\nknowledge and spatial awareness\u2014 or lack thereof. Recognizing and identifying what we do not know is an \\nimportant part of learning. It is only when we identify the unknown that we  are able to ask questions, \\ncollect information to answer those questions, develop knowledge through answers, and begin to \\nunderstand the world where we live. \\nAsking Geographic Questions \\nFilling in the gaps in our mental maps and, more generally, the gaps in our geographic knowledge requires \\nus to ask questions about the world where we live and how we relate to it. Such questions can be simple \\nwith a local focus (e.g., \u201cWhich way is the nearest hospital?\u201d) or more complex with a more global \\nperspective (e.g., \u201cHow is urbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world?\u201d). The thread \\nthat unifies such questions is geography. For instance, the question of \u201cwhere?\u201d is an essential part of the \\nquestions \u201cWhere is the nearest hospital?\u201d and \u201cWhere are the biodiversity hotspots in relation to cities?\u201d \\nBeing able to articulate questions clearly and to break them into manageable pieces are very valuable \\nskills when using and applying a geographic information system (GIS).  \\nThough there may be no such thing as a \u201cdumb\u201d question, some questions are indeed better than others. \\nLearning how to ask the right question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding the answer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  12 \\nitself. However, when we ask the right question, problems are more easily solved and our understanding \\nof the world is improved. There are five general types of geographic questions that we can ask and that \\nGIS can help us to answer. Each type of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples \\n(Nyerges 1991). [1] \\nQuestions about geographic location: \\n\u2022 Where is it? \\n\u2022 Why is it here or there? \\n\u2022 How much of it is here or there? \\nQuestions about geographic distribution: \\n\u2022 Is it distributed locally or globally? \\n\u2022 Is it spatially clustered or dispersed? \\n\u2022 Where are the boundaries? \\nQuestions about geographic association: \\n\u2022 What else is near it? \\n\u2022 What else occurs with it? \\n\u2022 What is absent in its presence? \\nQuestions about geographic interaction: \\n\u2022 Is it linked to something else? \\n\u2022 What is the nature of this association? \\n\u2022 How much interaction occurs between the locations? \\nQuestions about geographic change: \\n\u2022 Has it always been here? \\n\u2022 How has it changed over time and space? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  13 \\n\u2022 What causes its diffusion or contraction? \\nThese and related geographic questions are frequently asked by people from various areas of  expertise, \\nindustries, and professions. For instance, urban planners, traffic engineers, and demographers may be \\ninterested in understanding the commuting patterns between cities and suburbs (geographic interaction). \\nBiologists and botanists may be curious about why one animal or plant species flourishes in one place and \\nnot another (geographic location/distribution). Epidemiologists and public health officials are certainly \\ninterested in where disease outbreaks occur and how, why, and where they spread (g eographic \\nchange/interaction/location). \\nA GIS can assist in answering all these questions and many more. Furthermore, a GIS often opens up \\nadditional avenues of inquiry when searching for answers to geographic questions. Herein is one of the \\ngreatest strengths of the GIS. While a GIS can be used to answer specific questions or to solve particular \\nproblems, it often unearths even more interesting questions and presents more problems to be solved in \\nthe future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Mental maps are psychological tools that we use to understand, relate to, and navigate through the \\nenvironment in which we live, work, and play. \\n\u2022 Mental maps are unique to the individual. \\n\u2022 Learning how to ask geographic questions is important to using and applying GISs.  \\n\u2022 Geographic questions are concerned with location, distributions, associations, interactions, and change.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to introduce and explain how the key concepts of location, direction, \\ndistance, space, and navigation are relevant to geography and geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nBefore we can learn \u201chow to do\u201d a geographic information system (GIS), it is first necessary to review \\nand reconsider a few key geographic concepts that are often taken for granted. For instance, what is a \\nlocation and how can it be defined? At what distance does a location become \u201cnearby\u201d? Or what do \\nwe mean when we say that someone has a \u201cgood sense of direction\u201d? By answering these and related \\nquestions, we establish a framework that will help us to learn and to apply a GIS. This framework \\nwill also permit us to share and communicate geographic information with others, which can \\nfacilitate collaboration, problem solving, and decision making. \\nLocation \\nThe one concept that distinguishes geography from other fields is location, which is central to a \\nGIS. Location is simply a position on the surface of the earth. What is more, nearly everything can be \\nassigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of something, we can a put it on a map, for \\nexample, with a GIS. \\nGenerally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or absolute terms. In the case of the \\nformer, locations are simply defined and described by name. For example, city names such as New York, \\nTokyo, or London refer to nominal locations. Toponymy, or the study of place names and their respective \\nhistory and meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations (Monmonier 1996, 2006).  [1], [2] Though \\nwe tend to associate the notion of location with particular points on the surface of the earth, locations can \\nalso refer to geographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g., Siberia). The United States \\nBoard on Geographic Names (http://geonames.usgs.gov) maintains geographic naming standards and \\nkeeps track of such names through the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS; \\nhttp://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic). The GNIS database also provides information about which \\nstate and county the feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  16 \\nContrasting nominal locations are absolute locations that use some type of reference system to define \\npositions on the earth\u2019s surface. For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth using latitude \\nand longitude is an example of absolute location. Postal codes and street addresses are other examples of \\nabsolute location that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there is no global standard when it \\ncomes to street addresses, we can determine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of \\nparticular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and other geographic data through a pr ocess \\ncalled geocoding. There are several free online geocoders (e.g., http://worldkit.org/geocoder) that return \\nthe latitude and longitude for various locations and addresses around the world.  \\nWith the advent of the global positioning system (GPS) (see alsohttp://www.gps.gov), determining the \\nlocation of nearly any object on the surface of the earth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. \\nGPS technology consists of a constellation of twenty-four satellites that are orbiting the earth and \\nconstantly transmitting time signals (see Figure 1.4 \"Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) \\nSatellites\"). To determine a position, earth-based GPS units (e.g., handheld devices, car navigation \\nsystems, mobile phones) receive the signals from at least three of these satellites and use this information \\nto triangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate system (GCS) to report location. \\nOriginally developed by the United States Department of Defense for military purposes, there are now a \\nwide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  17 \\nFigure 1.4 Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites \\n \\nLocation can also be defined in relative terms. Relative location refers to defining and describing places in \\nrelation to other known locations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg, South Africa; New \\nZealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul, Afghanistan, is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike \\nnominal or absolute locations that define single points, relative locations provide a bit more information \\nand situate one place in relation to another. \\nDirection \\nLike location, the concept of direction is central to geography and GISs. Direction refers to the position of \\nsomething relative to something else usually along a line. In order to determine direction, a reference \\npoint or benchmark from which direction will be measured needs to be established. One of the most \\ncommon benchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric direction refers to when we use \\nourselves as a directional benchmark. Describing something as \u201cto my left,\u201d \u201cbehind me,\u201d or \u201cnext to me\u201d \\nare examples of egocentric direction. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  18 \\nAs the name suggests, landmark direction uses a known landmark or geographic feature as a benchmark \\nto determine direction. Such landmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point of interest \\nlike the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature like a mountain range or river. The important thing to \\nremember about landmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that the landmark should be \\nrelatively well-known. \\nIn geography and GISs, there are three more standard benchmarks that are used  to define the directions \\nof true north, magnetic north, and grid north. True north is based on the point at which the axis of the \\nearth\u2019s rotation intersects the earth\u2019s surface. In this respect the North and South Poles serve as the \\ngeographic benchmarks for determining direction. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the \\nsurface of the earth where the earth\u2019s magnetic fields converge. This is also the point to which magnetic \\ncompasses point. Note that magnetic north falls somewhere in northern Canada and is not geographically \\ncoincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid north simply refers to the northward direction that the \\ngrid lines of latitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point to.  \\nFigure 1.5 The Three Norths: True, Magnetic, and Grid \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  19 \\nSource: http://kenai.fws.gov/overview/notebook/2004/sept/3sep2004.htm \\nDistance \\nComplementing the concepts of location and direction is distance. Distance refers to the degree or amount \\nof separation between locations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with various units. We \\ncan describe the distances between locations nominally as \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall,\u201d or we can describe two or \\nmore locations as \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar apart.\u201d Absolute distance is measured or calculated using a standard \\nmetric. The formula for the distance between two points on a planar (i.e., flat) surface is the following: \\nD=(x2\u2212x1)2+(y2\u2212y1)2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a \\nCalculating the distance between two locations on the surface of the earth, ho wever, is a bit more involved \\nbecause we are dealing with a three-dimensional object. Moving from the three-dimensional earth to two-\\ndimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile devices is not a trivial matter and is discussed \\nin greater detail in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". \\nWe also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the distance between London and \\nSingapore can be measured in miles, kilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship. \\nWhether or not such distances make London and Singapore \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar\u201d from each other is a matter of \\nopinion, experience, and patience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that derived from \\nthe distance formula, provide a standardized method to measure how far away o r how near locations are \\nfrom each other. \\nSpace \\nWhere distance suggests a measurable quantity in terms of how far apart locations are situated, space is a \\nmore abstract concept that is more commonly described rather than measured. For example, space can be  \\ndescribed as \u201cempty,\u201d \u201cpublic,\u201d or \u201cprivate.\u201d \\nWithin the scope of a GIS, we are interested in space, and in particular, we are interested in what fills \\nparticular spaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this sense,  space is a somewhat \\nambiguous and generic term that is used to denote the general geographic area of interest.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  20 \\nOne kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is topological space. Simply put, topological \\nspace is concerned with the nature of relationships and the connectivity of locations within a given space. \\nWhat is important within topological space are (1) how locations are (or are not) related or connected to \\neach other and (2) the rules that govern such geographic relationships.  \\nTransportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the best illustrations of topological \\nspaces (see Figure 1.6 \"Metro Map from London\" and Figure 1.7 \"Metro Map from Moscow\"). When using \\nsuch maps, we are primarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another along  a transportation \\nnetwork. Certain rules also govern how we can travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible \\nonly at a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular line). Such maps may be of little \\nuse when traveling around a city by car or foot, but they show the local transportation network and how \\nlocations are linked together in an effective and efficient manner.  \\nFigure 1.6 Metro Map from London \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  21 \\nFigure 1.7 Metro Map from Moscow \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  22 \\nNavigation \\nTransportation maps like those discussed previously illustrate how we move through the environments \\nwhere we live, work, and play. This movement and, in particular, destination-oriented travel are generally \\nreferred to as navigation. How we navigate through space is a complex pro cess that blends together our \\nvarious motor skills; technology; mental maps; and awareness of locations, distances, directions, and the \\nspace where we live (Golledge and Stimson 1997). [3] What is more, our geographical knowledge and \\nspatial awareness is continuously updated and changed as we move from one location to another.  \\nThe acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor. Though several factors influence the \\nnature of such knowledge, we tend to rely on the three following types of geograph ic knowledge when \\nnavigating through space: \\n1. Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and identify unique points, patterns, or features \\n(e.g., landmarks) in space. \\n2. Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between landmarks by moving throug h space. \\n3. Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks are in relation to each other and to take \\nshortcuts. \\nEach type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after the other. For instance, when we find \\nourselves in a new or an unfamiliar location, we usually identify a few unique points of interest (e.g., \\nhotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are in essence building up our landmark knowledge. \\nUsing and traveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge and rei nforces our landmark \\nknowledge and our overall geographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin to \\nunderstand how routes connect landmarks together and how various locations are situated in space. It is \\nat this point, when we are somewhat comfortable with our survey knowledge, that we are able to take \\nshortcuts from one location to another. Though there is no guarantee that a shortcut will be successful, if \\nwe get lost, we are at least expanding our local geographic knowledge.  \\nLandmark, route, and survey knowledge are the cornerstones of having a sense of direction and frame our \\ngeographical learning and awareness. While some would argue that they are born with a good sense of \\ndirection, others admit to always getting lost. The popularity of personal navigation devices and online Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  23 \\nmapping services speaks to the overwhelming desire to know and to situate where we are in the world. \\nThough developing and maintaining a keen sense of direction presumably matters less and less as such \\ndevices and services continue to develop and spread, it can also be argued that the more we know about \\nwhere we are in the world, the more we will want to learn about it.  \\nThis section covers concepts essential to geography, GISs, and many other fields of interest. \\nUnderstanding how location, direction, and distance can be defined and described provides an important \\nfoundation for the successful use and implementation of a GIS. Thinking about space and how we \\nnavigate through it also serves to improve and own geographic knowledge and spatial awareness. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Location refers to the position of an object on the surface of the earth and is commonly expressed in \\nterms of latitude and longitude. \\n\u2022 Direction is always determined relative to a benchmark. \\n\u2022 Distance refers to the separation between locations. \\n\u2022 Navigation is the destination-oriented movement through space. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Find your hometown in the GNIS and see what other features share this name. Explore the toponymy of \\nyour hometown online. \\n2. How are GPSs and related navigation technology influencing how we learn about our local environments?  \\n3. Does navigation technology improve or impede our sense of direction and learning about where we live?  \\n4. Compare and contrast the driving directions between two locations provided by two different online \\nmapping services (e.g., Google Maps vs. Yahoo! Maps). Is there a discrepancy?

The objective of this section is to define and describe how a geographic information system (GIS) is \\napplied, its development, and its future. \\nUp to this point, the primary concern of this chapter was to introduce concepts essential to \\ngeography that are also relevant to geographic information systems (GISs). Furthermore, the \\nintroduction of these concepts was prefaced by an overview of how we think spatially and the nature \\nof geographic inquiry. This final section is concerned with defining a GIS, describing its use, and \\nexploring its future. \\nGIS Defined \\nSo what exactly is a GIS? Is it computer software? Is it a collection of computer hardware? I s it a service \\nthat is distributed and accessed via the Internet? Is it a tool? Is it a system? Is it a science? The answer to \\nall these questions is, \u201cGIS is all of the above\u2014 and more.\u201d \\nFrom a software perspective, a GIS consists of a special type of computer program capable of storing, \\nediting, processing, and presenting geographic data and information as maps. There are several GIS \\nsoftware providers, such as Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. ( http://www.esri.com), which \\ndistributes ArcGIS, and PitneyBowes (http://www.pbinsight.com), which distributes MapInfo GIS. \\nThough online mapping services and interfaces are provided by companies like Google, Yahoo!, and \\nMicrosoft, such services are not (yet) considered fully fledged GIS platforms. There are also open -source \\nGIS options, such as GRASS (http://grass.itc.it), which is freely distributed and maintained by the open-\\nsource community. All GIS software, regardless of vendor, consists of a database management system that \\nis capable of handling and integrating two types of data: spatial data and attribute data.  \\nSpatial data refer to the real-world geographic objects of interest, such as streets, buildings, lakes, and \\ncountries, and their respective locations. In addition to location, each of these objects also possesses \\ncertain traits of interest, or attributes, such as a name, number of stories, depth, or population. GIS \\nsoftware keeps track of both the spatial and attribute data and permits us to link the two types of data \\ntogether to create information and facilitate analysis. One popular way to describe and to visualize a GIS Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  25 \\nis picturing it as a cake with many layers. Each layer of the cake represents a different geographic theme, \\nsuch as water features, buildings, and roads, and each layer is stacked one on top of another (see  Figure \\n1.8 \"A GIS as a Layered Cake\"). \\nFigure 1.8 A GIS as a Layered Cake \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  26 \\nAs hardware, a GIS consists of a computer, memory, storage devices, scanners, printers, global \\npositioning system (GPS) units, and other physical components. If the computer is situated on a network, \\nthe network can also be considered an integral component of the GIS because it enables us to share data \\nand information that the GIS uses as inputs and creates as outputs.  \\nAs a tool, a GIS permits us to maintain, analyze, and share a wealth of data and information. From the \\nrelatively simple task of mapping the path of a hurricane to the more c omplex task of determining the \\nmost efficient garbage collection routes in a city, a GIS is used across the public and private sectors. \\nOnline and mobile mapping, navigation, and location-based services are also personalizing and \\ndemocratizing GISs by bringing maps and mapping to the masses. \\nThese are just a few definitions of a GIS. Like several of the geographic concepts discussed previously, \\nthere is no single or universally accepted definition of a GIS. There are probably just as many definitions \\nof GISs as there are people who use GISs. In this regard, it is the people like you who are learning, \\napplying, developing, and studying GISs in new and compelling ways that unifies it.  \\nThree Approaches to GISs \\nIn addition to recognizing the many definitions of a GIS, it is also constructive to identify three general \\nand overlapping approaches to understanding GISs\u2014 the application approach, the developer approach, \\nand the science approach. Though most GIS users would probably identify with one approach more than \\nanother, they are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, as GISs and, more generally, information technology \\nadvance, the following categories will be transformed and reshaped accordingly.  \\nThe application approach to GISs considers a GIS primarily to be a tool.  This is also perhaps the most \\ncommon view of a GIS. From this perspective, a GIS is used to answer questions, support decision \\nmaking, maintain an inventory of geographic data and information, and, of course, make maps. As a tool, \\nthere are arguably certain skills that should be acquired and required in order to use and apply a GIS \\nproperly. The application approach to a GIS is more concerned with using and applying GISs to solve \\nproblems than the GIS itself. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  27 \\nFor instance, suppose we want to determine the best location for a new supermarket. What factors are \\nimportant behind making this decision? Information about neighborhood demographics, existing \\nsupermarkets, the location of suppliers, zoning regulations, and available real estate are all critical to th is \\ndecision. A GIS platform can integrate such information that is obtained from the census bureau, realtors, \\nthe local zoning agency, and even the Internet. A suitability analysis can then be carried out with the GIS, \\nthe output of which will show the best locations for the supermarket given the various local geographic \\nopportunities (e.g., demographics/consumers) and constraints (e.g., supply chain, zoning, and real estate \\nlimitations) that exist. \\nThere are several professional communities and organizations concerned with the use and application of a \\nGIS, such as the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association ( http://urisa.org) and the Global \\nSpatial Data Infrastructure Association (http://www.gsdi.org). \\nUnlike the previous example in which a GIS is applied to answer or solve a particular question, the \\ndeveloper approach to GISs is concerned with the development of the GIS as a software or technology \\nplatform. Rather than focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned \\nwith improving, refining, and extending the tool and technology itself and is largely in the realm of \\ncomputer programmers and software developers. \\nThe ongoing integration and evolution of GISs, maps, the Internet, and web-based mapping can be \\nconsidered an outcome of the developer approach to GISs. In this regard, delivering maps, navigation \\ntools, and user-friendly GISs to people via the Internet is the central challenge at hand. The underlying, \\nand to a large extent hidden, logic and computer code that permit us to ask questions about how to get \\nfrom point A to point B on a navigation website or to see where a new restaurant or open house is located \\non a web-based map are for the most part the domain of GIS programmers and developers. The Open \\nSource Geospatial Foundation (http://www.osgeo.org) is another example of a community of GIS \\ndevelopers working to build and distribute open-source GIS software. \\nIt is the developer approach to GISs that drives and introduces innovation and is informed and guided by \\nthe existing needs and future demands of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting \\nedge, it is dynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  28 \\nThe science approach to GISs not only dovetails with the applications and developer approaches but also \\nis more concerned with broader questions and how geography, cognition, m ap interpretation, and other \\ngeospatial issues such as accuracy and errors are relevant to GISs and vice versa (see Longley et al. \\n2005). [1] This particular approach is often referred to as geographic information science (GIScience), and \\nit is also interested in the social consequences and implications of the use and diffusion of GIS technology. \\nFrom exploring the propagation of error to examining how privacy is being redefined by GISs and related \\ntechnology, GIScience is at the same time an agent of change as well as one of understanding. \\nIn light of the rapid rate of technological and GIS innovation, in conjunction with the widespread \\napplication of GISs, new questions about GIS technology and its use are continually emerging. One of the \\nmost discussed topics concerns privacy, and in particular, what is referred to as locational privacy. In \\nother words, who has the right to view or determine your geographic location at any given time? Your \\nparents? Your school? Your employer? Your cell phone carrier? The government or police? When are you \\nwilling to divulge your location? Is there a time or place where you prefer to be \u201coff the grid\u201d or not \\nlocatable? Such questions concerning locational privacy were of relatively little concern a few years ago. \\nHowever, with the advent of GPS and its integration into cars and other mobile devices, questions, \\ndebates, and even lawsuits concerning locational privacy and who has the right to such information are \\nrapidly emerging. \\nAs the name suggests, the developer approach to GISs is concerned with the development of GISs. Rather \\nthan focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned with improving, \\nrefining, and extending the tool itself and is largely in the realm of computer programmers an d software \\ndevelopers. For instance, the advent of web-based mapping is an outcome of the developer approach to \\nGISs. In this regard, the challenge was how to bring GISs to people via the Internet and not necessarily \\nhow people would use web-based GISs. The developer approach to GISs drives and introduces innovation \\nand is guided by the needs of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting edge, it is \\ndynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  \\nGIS Futures Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  29 \\nThe definitions and approaches to GISs described previously illustrate the scope and breadth of this \\nspecial type of information technology. Furthermore, as GISs become more accessible and widely \\ndistributed, there will always be new questions to be answered, new applications to be developed, and \\ninnovative technologies to integrate. \\nOne notable development is the emergence of what is called the geospatial web. The geospatial web or \\ngeoweb refers to the integration of the vast amounts of content available on t he Internet (e.g., text, \\nphotographs, video, and music) with geographic information, such as location. Adding such geographic \\ninformation to such content is called geotagging and is similar to geocoding. The integration of geographic \\ninformation with such content opens up new ways to access, search, organize, share, and distribute \\ninformation. \\nMapping mashups, or web-based applications that combine data and information from one source and \\nmap it with online mapping applications, are an example of the geoweb  at work. There are mashups for \\nnearly everything that can be assigned a location, from restaurants and music festivals to your \\nphotographs and favorite hikes. Several examples of such mapping mashups can be found on the Internet \\nat sites such as http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com. \\nThough the geoweb may not necessarily be considered a GIS, it certainly draws upon the same concepts \\nand ideas of geography and may someday encompass GISs. Perhaps more important, the diffusion of GISs \\nand the emergence of the geoweb have increased geographic awareness by lowering the barriers of \\nviewing, using, and even creating maps and related geographic data and information. Though there are \\nseveral benefits to this democratization of GISs, and more generally information and technology, it should \\nalso be recognized that there are also consequences and implications.  \\nAs with any other technology, great care must be taken in the use and application of GISs. For instance, \\nwhen was the last time you questioned what appeared on a map? For better or worse, maps are among the \\nmost authoritative forms of information and are the subject of Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". As tomorrow\u2019s \\nGIS practitioners, you will have the ability to influence greatly how decisions are made and how others \\nview and relate to the world with the maps that you create in a GIS environment. What and how you Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  30 \\nchoose to map is therefore a nontrivial exercise. Becoming more aware of our biases, limitations, and \\npreferences permits us to take full advantage of geographic information systems with confidence.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 There is no single or universal definition of a GIS; it is defined and used in many different ways.  \\n\u2022 One of the key features of a GIS is that it integrates spatial data with attribute data. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Explore the web for mapping mashups that match your personal interests. How can they be improved?  \\n2. Create your own mapping mashup with a free online mapping service. \\n \\n[1] Longley, P., M.

The objective of this section is to define what a map is and to describe reference, thematic, and dynamic \\nmaps. \\nMaps are among the most compelling forms of information for several reasons. Maps are artistic. Maps \\nare scientific. Maps preserve history. Maps clarify. Maps reveal the invisible. Maps inform the future. \\nRegardless of the reason, maps capture the imagination of people around the world. As one of the most \\ntrusted forms of information, map makers and geographic information system (GIS) practitioners hold a \\nconsiderable amount of power and influence (Wood 1992; Monmonier 1996).  [1], [2] Therefore, \\nunderstanding and appreciating maps and how maps convey information are important aspects of GISs. \\nThe appreciation of maps begins with exploring various map types.  \\nSo what exactly is a map? Like GISs, there are probably just as many definitions of maps as there are \\npeople who use and make them (see Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998). [3] For starters, we can define a map \\nsimply as a representation of the world. Such maps can be stored in our brain (i.e., mental maps), they can \\nbe printed on paper, or they can appear online. Notwithstanding the actual medium of the map (e.g., our \\nfleeting thoughts, paper, or digital display), maps represent and describe various aspects of the world. For \\npurposes of clarity, the three types of maps are the reference map, the thematic map, and the dynamic \\nmap. \\nReference Maps \\nThe primary purpose of a reference map is to deliver location information to the map user. Geographic \\nfeatures and map elements on a reference map tend to be treated and represented equally. In other words, \\nno single aspect of a reference map takes precedent over any other aspect. Moreover, reference maps \\ngenerally represent geographic reality accurately. Examples of some common types of reference maps \\ninclude topographic maps such as those created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS; \\nseehttp://topomaps.usgs.gov) and image maps obtained from satellites or aircraft that are available \\nthrough online mapping services. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  33 \\nFigure 2.1 USGS Topographic Map of Boulder, CO \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  34 \\nFigure 2.2 Image Map of Palm Island, Dubai, from NASA \\n \\nThe accuracy of a given reference map is indeed critical to many users. For instance, local governments \\nneed accurate reference maps for land use, zoning, and tax purposes. National governments need accurate \\nreference maps for political, infrastructure, and military purposes. People who depend on navigation \\ndevices like global positioning system (GPS) units also need accurate and up -to-date reference maps in \\norder to arrive at their desired destinations. \\nThematic Maps \\nContrasting the reference map are thematic maps. As the name suggests, thematic  maps are concerned \\nwith a particular theme or topic of interest. While reference maps emphasize the location of geographic \\nfeatures, thematic maps are more concerned with how things are distributed across space . Such things are \\noften abstract concepts such as life expectancy around the world, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \\nin Europe, or literacy rates across India. One of the strengths of mapping, and in particular of thematic \\nmapping, is that it can make such abstract and invisible concepts visible and comparable on a map.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  35 \\nFigure 2.3 World Life Expectancies \\n \\nFigure 2.4 European GDP \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  36 \\nFigure 2.5 Indian Literacy Rates \\n \\nIt is important to note that reference and thematic maps are not mutually exclusive. In other words, \\nthematic maps often contain and combine geographical reference information, and conversely, reference \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  37 \\nmaps may contain thematic information. What is more, when used in conjunction, thematic and reference \\nmaps often complement each other. \\nFor example, public health officials in a city may be interested in providing equal access to emergency \\nrooms to the city\u2019s residents. Insights into this and related questions can be obtained through visual \\ncomparisons of a reference map that shows the locations of emergency rooms across the city to thematic \\nmaps of various segments of the population (e.g., households below poverty, percent elderly, \\nunderrepresented groups). \\nWithin the context of a GIS, we can overlay the reference map of emergency rooms directly on top of the \\npopulation maps to see whether or not access is uniform across neighborhood types. Clearly, there are \\nother factors to consider when looking at emergency room access (e.g., access to transport), but through \\nsuch map overlays, underserved neighborhoods can be identified. \\nFigure 2.6 Map Overlay Process \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  38 \\nWhen presented in hardcopy format, both reference and thematic maps are static or fixed representations \\nof reality. Such permanence on the page suggests that geography and the things that we map are also in \\nmany ways fixed or constant. This is far from reality. The integration of GISs with other forms of \\ninformation technology like the Internet and mobile telecommunications is rapidly changing this view of \\nmaps and mapping, as well as geography at large. \\nDynamic Maps \\nThe diffusion of GISs and the popularity of online mapping tools and applications speak to this shift in \\nthinking about maps and map use. In this regard, it is worthwhile to discuss the diffusion of dynamic \\nmaps. Dynamic maps are simply changeable or interactive representations of the earth. Dynamic mapping \\nrefers more to how maps are used and delivered to the map user today (e.g., online, via mobile phone) \\nthan to the content of the map itself. Both reference and thematic maps can be dynamic in nature, and \\nsuch maps are an integral component to any GIS. The key point about dynamic maps is that more and \\nmore people, not just GIS professionals, have access to such maps. \\nUnlike a hardcopy map that has features and elements users cannot modify or change, dynamic maps \\nencourage and sometimes require user interaction. Such interaction can include changing the scale or \\nvisible area by zooming in or zooming out, selecting which features or layers to include or to remove from \\na map (e.g., roads, imagery), or even starting and stopping a map animation.  \\nFigure 2.7 Google Maps on an iPhone \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  39 \\nFigure 2.8 Polar Ice Cap \\n \\nTo see the animation, go to http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?3464. \\nJust as dynamic maps will continue to evolve and require more user interaction in the future, map users \\nwill demand more interactive map features and controls. As this democratization of maps and mapping \\ncontinues, the geographic awareness and map appreciation of map users will also increase. Therefore, it is \\nof critical importance to understand the nature, form, and content of maps to support the changing needs , \\ndemands, and expectations of map users in the future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The main purpose of a reference map is to show the location of geographical objects of interest.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  40 \\n\u2022 Thematic maps are concerned with showing how one or more geographical aspects are distributed across \\nspace. \\n\u2022 Dynamic maps refer to maps that are changeable and often require user interaction.  \\n\u2022 The democratization of maps and mapping is increasing access, use, and appreciation for all types of \\nmaps, as well as driving map innovations. \\n \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to describe and discuss the concepts of map scale, coordinate systems, and \\nmap projections and explain why they are central to maps, mapping, and geographic information systems \\n(GISs). \\nAll map users and map viewers have certain expectations about what is contained on a map. Such \\nexpectations are formed and learned from previous experience by working with maps. It is important \\nto note that such expectations also change with increased exposure to maps. Understanding and \\nmeeting the expectations of map viewers is a challenging but necessary task because such \\nexpectations provide a starting point for the creation of any map. \\nThe central purpose of a map is to provide relevant and useful information to the map user. In order \\nfor a map to be of value, it must convey information effectively and efficiently. Mapping conventions \\nfacilitate the delivery of information in such a manner by recognizing and managing the expectations \\nof map users. Generally speaking, mapping or cartographic conventions refer to the accepted rules, \\nnorms, and practices behind the making of maps. One of the most recognized mapping conventions \\nis that \u201cnorth is up\u201d on most maps. Though this may not always be the case, many map users expect \\nnorth to be oriented or to coincide with the top edge of a map or viewing device like a computer \\nmonitor. \\nSeveral other formal and informal mapping conventions and characteristics, many of which are \\ntaken for granted, can be identified. Among the most important cartographic considerations are map \\nscale, coordinate systems, and map projections. Map scale is concerned with reducing geographical \\nfeatures of interest to manageable proportions, coordinate systems help us define the positions of \\nfeatures on the surface of the earth, and map projections are concerned with moving from the three-\\ndimensional world to the two dimensions of a flat map or display, all of which are discussed in \\ngreater detail in this chapter. \\nMap Scale Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  42 \\nThe world is a big place\u2026really big. One of the challenges behind mapping the world and its resident \\nfeatures, patterns, and processes is reducing it to a manageable size. What exactly is meant by \\n\u201cmanageable\u201d is open to discussion and largely depends on the purpose and needs of the map at hand. \\nNonetheless, all maps reduce or shrink the world and its geographic features of interest by some \\nfactor. Map scale refers to the factor of reduction of the world so it fits on a map.  \\nMap scale can be represented by text, a graphic, or some combination of the two. For example, it is \\ncommon to see \u201cone inch represents one kilometer\u201d or something similar written on a map to give map \\nusers an idea of the scale of the map. Map scale can also be portrayed graphically with what is called a \\nscale bar. Scale bars are usually used on reference maps and allow map users to approximate distances \\nbetween locations and features on a map, as well as to get an overall idea of the scale of the map.  \\nFigure 2.9 Map Scale from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Map \\n \\nThe representative fraction (RF) describes scale as a simple ratio. The numerator, which is always set to \\none (i.e., 1), denotes map distance and the denominator denotes ground or \u201creal-world\u201d distance. One of \\nthe benefits of using a representative fraction to describe scale is that it is unit neutral. In other words, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  43 \\nany unit of measure can be used to interpret the map scale. Consider a map with an RF of 1:10,000. This \\nmeans that one unit on the map represents 10,000 units on the ground. Such units could be inches, \\ncentimeters, or even pencil lengths; it really does not matter. \\nMap scales can also be described as either \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge.\u201d Such descriptions are usually made in \\nreference to representative fractions and the amount of detail represented on a map. For instance, a map \\nwith an RF of 1:1,000 is considered a large-scale map when compared to a map with an RF of 1:1,000,000 \\n(i.e., 1:1,000 > 1:1,000,000). Furthermore, while the large-scale map shows more detail and less area, the \\nsmall-scale map shows more area but less detail. Clearly, determining the thresholds for small - or large-\\nscale maps is largely a judgment call. \\nAll maps possess a scale, whether it is formally expressed or not. Though some say that online maps and \\nGISs are \u201cscaleless\u201d because we can zoom in and out at will, it is probably more accurate to say that GISs \\nand related mapping technology are multiscalar. Understanding map scale and its overall impact on h ow \\nthe earth and its features are represented is a critical part of both map making and GISs.  \\nCoordinate Systems \\nJust as all maps have a map scale, all maps have locations, too. Coordinate  systems are frameworks that \\nare used to define unique positions. For instance, in geometry we use x (horizontal) and y (vertical) \\ncoordinates to define points on a two-dimensional plane. The coordinate system that is most commonly \\nused to define locations on the three-dimensional earth is called the geographic coordinate system (GCS), \\nand it is based on a sphere or spheroid. A spheroid (a.k.a. ellipsoid  is simply a sphere that is slightly wider \\nthan it is tall and approximates more closely the true shape of the earth. Spheres are commonly used as \\nmodels of the earth for simplicity. \\nThe unit of measure in the GCS is degrees, and locations are defined by their respective latitude and \\nlongitude within the GCS. Latitude is measured relative to the equator at zero degrees, with maxima of \\neither ninety degrees north at the North Pole or ninety degrees south at the South Pole. Longitude is \\nmeasured relative to the prime meridian at zero degrees, with maxima of 180 degrees west or 180 degrees \\neast. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  44 \\nNote that latitude and longitude can be expressed in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) or in decimal \\ndegrees (DD). When using decimal degrees, latitudes above the equator and longitudes east of the prime \\nmeridian are positive, and latitudes below the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian are \\nnegative (see the following table for examples). \\n \\nNominal location Absolute location (DMS) Absolute location (DD) \\nLos Angeles, US 34\u00b0 3\u2032 North, 118\u00b0 15\u2032 West +34.05, \u2013118.25 \\nMumbai, India 18\u00b0 58\u2032 North, 72\u00b0 49\u2032 East +18.975, +72.8258 \\nSydney, Australia 33\u00b0 51\u2032 South, 151\u00b0 12\u2032 East \u201333.859, 151.211 \\nSao Paolo, Brazil 23\u00b0 33\u2032 South, 46\u00b0 38\u2032 West \u201323.550, \u201346.634 \\nConverting from DMS to DD is a relatively straightforward exercise. For example, since there are sixty \\nminutes in one degree, we can convert 118\u00b0 15 minutes to 118.25 (118 + 15/60). Note that an online search \\nof the term \u201ccoordinate conversion\u201d will return several coordinate conversion tools. \\nWhen we want to map things like mountains, rivers, streets, and buildings, we need to define how the \\nlines of latitude and longitude will be oriented and positioned on the sphere. A datum serves this purpose \\nand specifies exactly the orientation and origins of the lines of latitude and longitude relative to the center \\nof the earth or spheroid. \\nDepending on the need, situation, and location, there are several datums to choose from. For instance, \\nlocal datums try to match closely the spheroid to the earth\u2019s surface in a local area and return accurate \\nlocal coordinates. A common local datum used in the United States is  called NAD83 (i.e., North American \\nDatum of 1983). For locations in the United States and Canada, NAD83 returns relatively accurate \\npositions, but positional accuracy deteriorates when outside of North America.  \\nThe global WGS84 datum (i.e., World Geodetic System of 1984) uses the center of the earth as the origin \\nof the GCS and is used for defining locations across the globe. Because the datum uses the center of the \\nearth as its origin, locational measurements tend to be more consistent regardless where th ey are \\nobtained on the earth, though they may be less accurate than those returned by a local datum. Note that \\nswitching between datums will alter the coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) for all locations of \\ninterest. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  45 \\nMap Projections \\nPreviously we noted that the earth is really big. Not only is it big, but it is a big round spherical shape \\ncalled a spheroid. A globe is a very common and very good representation of the three- dimensional, \\nspheroid earth. One of the problems with globes, however, is that they are not very portable (i.e., you \\ncannot fold a globe and put in it in your pocket), and their small scale makes them of limited practical use \\n(i.e., geographic detail is sacrificed). To overcome these issues, it is necessary to transform the three -\\ndimensional shape of the earth to a two-dimensional surface like a flat piece of paper, computer screen, or \\nmobile device display in order to obtain more useful map forms and map scales. Enter the map projection.  \\nMap projections refer to the methods and procedures that are used to transform the spherical three-\\ndimensional earth into two-dimensional planar surfaces. Specifically, map projections are mathematical \\nformulas that are used to translate latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth to  x and y \\ncoordinates on a plane. Since there are an infinite number of ways this translation can be performed, \\nthere are an infinite number of map projections. The mathematics behind map projections are beyond the \\nscope of this introductory overview (but see Robinson et al. 1995; Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998), [1] and \\nfor simplicity, the following discussion focuses on describing types of map projections, the distortions \\ninherent to map projections, and the selection of appropriate map projections.  \\nTo illustrate the concept of a map projection, imagine that we place a light bulb in the center of a \\ntranslucent globe. On the globe are outlines of the continents and the lines of longitude and latitude called \\nthe graticule. When we turn the light bulb on, the outline of the continents and the graticule will be \\n\u201cprojected\u201d as shadows on the wall, ceiling, or any other nearby surface. This is what is meant by map \\n\u201cprojection.\u201d \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  46 \\nFigure 2.10 The Concept of Map \u201cProjection\u201d \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps and mapping, there are three surfaces used for map projections (i.e., surfaces \\non which we project the shadows of the graticule). These surfaces are the plane, the cylinder, and the \\ncone. Referring again to the previous example of a light bulb in the center of a globe, note that during the \\nprojection process, we can situate each surface in any number of ways. For example, surfaces can be \\ntangential to the globe along the equator or poles, they can pass through or intersect the surfa ce, and they \\ncan be oriented at any number of angles. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  47 \\nFigure 2.11 Map Projection Surfaces \\n \\nIn fact, naming conventions for many map projections include the surface as well as its orientation. For \\nexample, as the name suggests, \u201cplanar\u201d projections use the plane, \u201ccylindrical\u201d projections use cylinders, \\nand \u201cconic\u201d projections use the cone. For cylindrical projections, the \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d aspect refers \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  48 \\nto when the cylinder is tangential to the equator (i.e., the axis of the cylinder is oriented north \u2013south). \\nWhen the axis of the cylinder is perfectly oriented east\u2013west, the aspect is called \u201ctransverse,\u201d and all \\nother orientations are referred to as \u201coblique.\u201d Regardless the orientation or the surface on which a \\nprojection is based, a number of distortions will be introduced that will influence the choice of map \\nprojection. \\nWhen moving from the three-dimensional surface of the earth to a two-dimensional plane, distortions are \\nnot only introduced but also inevitable. Generally, map projections introduce  distortions in distance, \\nangles, and areas. Depending on the purpose of the map, a series of trade -offs will need to be made with \\nrespect to such distortions. \\nMap projections that accurately represent distances are referred to as equidistant projections. Note that \\ndistances are only correct in one direction, usually running north\u2013south, and are not correct everywhere \\nacross the map. Equidistant maps are frequently used for small-scale maps that cover large areas because \\nthey do a good job of preserving the shape of geographic features such as continents. \\nMaps that represent angles between locations, also referred to as bearings, are called conformal. \\nConformal map projections are used for navigational purposes due to the importance of maintaining a \\nbearing or heading when traveling great distances. The cost of preserving bearings is that areas tend to be \\nquite distorted in conformal map projections. Though shapes are more or less preserved over small areas, \\nat small scales areas become wildly distorted. The Mercator projection is an example of a conformal \\nprojection and is famous for distorting Greenland. \\nAs the name indicates, equal area or equivalent projections preserve the quality of area. Such projections \\nare of particular use when accurate measures or comparisons of geographical distributions are necessary \\n(e.g., deforestation, wetlands). In an effort to maintain true proportions in the surface of the earth, \\nfeatures sometimes become compressed or stretched depending on the orientation of the projection.  \\nMoreover, such projections distort distances as well as angular relationships.  \\nAs noted earlier, there are theoretically an infinite number of map projections to choose from. One of the \\nkey considerations behind the choice of map projection is to reduce the amount of distortion. The \\ngeographical object being mapped and the respective scale at which the map will be constructed are also Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  49 \\nimportant factors to think about. For instance, maps of the North and South Poles usually use planar or \\nazimuthal projections, and conical projections are best suited for the middle latitude areas of the earth. \\nFeatures that stretch east\u2013west, such as the country of Russia, are represented well with the standard \\ncylindrical projection, while countries oriented north\u2013south (e.g., Chile, Norway) are better represented \\nusing a transverse projection. \\nIf a map projection is unknown, sometimes it can be identified by working backward and examining \\nclosely the nature and orientation of the graticule (i.e., grid of latitude and longitu de), as well as the \\nvarying degrees of distortion. Clearly, there are trade-offs made with regard to distortion on every map. \\nThere are no hard-and-fast rules as to which distortions are more preferred over others. Therefore, the \\nselection of map projection largely depends on the purpose of the map. \\nWithin the scope of GISs, knowing and understanding map projections are critical. For instance, in order \\nto perform an overlay analysis like the one described earlier, all map layers need to be in the same \\nprojection. If they are not, geographical features will not be aligned properly, and any analyses performed \\nwill be inaccurate and incorrect. Most GISs include functions to assist in the identification of map \\nprojections, as well as to transform between projections in order to synchronize spatial data. Despite the \\ncapabilities of technology, an awareness of the potential and pitfalls that surround map projections is \\nessential. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map scale refers to the factor by which the real world is reduced to fit on a map.  \\n\u2022 A GIS is multiscalar. \\n\u2022 Map projections are mathematical formulas used to transform the three -dimensional earth to two \\ndimensions (e.g., paper maps, computer monitors). \\n\u2022 Map projections introduce distortions in distance, direction, and area.  \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the decision-making process behind maps and to underscore \\nthe need to be explicit and consistent when mapping and using geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nAs previously discussed, maps are a representation of the earth. Central to this representation is the \\nreduction of the earth and its features of interest to a manageable size (i.e., map scale) and its \\ntransformation into a useful two-dimensional form (i.e., map projection). The choice of both map \\nscale and, to a lesser extent, map projection will influence the content and shape of the map. \\nIn addition to the seemingly objective decisions made behind the choices of map scale and map \\nprojection are those concerning what to include and what to omit from the map. The purpose of a \\nmap will certainly guide some of these decisions, but other choices may be based on factors such as \\nspace limitations, map complexity, and desired accuracy. Furthermore, decisions about how to \\nclassify, simplify, or exaggerate features and how to symbolize objects of interest simultaneously fall \\nunder the realms of art and science (Slocum et al. 2004). [1] \\nThe process of moving from the \u201creal world\u201d to the world of maps is referred to as map abstraction. \\nThis process not only involves making choices about how to represent features but also, more \\nimportant with regard to geographic information systems (GISs), requires us to be explicit, \\nconsistent, and precise in terms of defining and describing geographical features of interest. Failure \\nto be explicit, consistent, and precise will return incorrect; inconsistent; and error-prone maps, \\nanalyses, and decisions based on such maps and GISs. This final section discusses map abstraction in \\nterms of geographical features and their respective graphical representation. \\nWhat Is a Forest? \\nOne of the most pressing environmental issues facing the world is deforestation. Generally, deforestation \\nrefers to the reduction of forest area. This is an important issue because it has possible implications for \\nclimate change, global warming, biodiversity, and the water balance of the earth, among other things. In \\nthe last century, deforestation has increased at an alarming rate and is mostly attributed to human Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  52 \\nactivity. Mapping forests regularly with a GIS is a logical way to monitor deforestation and has the \\npotential to inform policies regarding forest conservation efforts. Easy enough, so let\u2019s get started. \\nSo what exactly is a forest? How do we know where a forest begins and where it ends? How can naturally \\ncaused forest fires be differentiated from those started by humans? Can a forest exist in a swamp or \\nwetland? For that matter, what is the difference between a swamp and wetland? Such questions are  not \\ntrivial in the context of mapping and GISs. In fact, consistent and precise definitions of features like \\nforests or swamps increase the reliability and efficiency of maps, mapping, and analysis with GISs.  \\nFigure 2.12 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2001 \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  53 \\nFigure 2.13 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2009 \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps, cartography, and GISs, the world is made up of various features or entities. \\nSuch entities include but are not restricted to fire hydrants, caves, roads, rivers, lakes, hills, va lleys, \\noceans, and the occasional barn. Moreover, such features have a form, and more precisely, a geometric \\nform. For instance, fire hydrants and geysers are considered point-like features; rivers and streams are \\nlinear features; and lakes, countries, and forests are areal features. \\nFeatures can also be categorized as either discrete or continuous. Discrete  features are well defined and \\nare easy to locate, measure, and count, and their edges or boundaries are readily defined. Examples of \\ndiscrete features in a city include buildings, roads, traffic signals, and parks. Continuous  features, on the \\nother hand, are less well defined and exist across space. The most commonly cited examples of continuous \\nfeatures are temperature and elevation. Changes in both temperature and elevation tend to be gradual \\nover relatively large areas. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  54 \\nGeographical features also have several characteristics, traits, or attributes that may or may not be of \\ninterest. For instance, to continue the deforestation example, determining wheth er a forest is a rainforest \\nor whether a forest is in a protected park may be important. More general attributes may include \\nmeasurements such as tree density per acre, average canopy height in meters, or proportions like percent \\npalm trees or invasive species per hectare in the forest. \\nNotwithstanding the purpose of the map or GIS project at hand, it is critical that definitions of features \\nare clear and remain consistent. Similarly, it is important that the attributes of features are also \\nconsistently defined, measured, and reported in order to generate accurate and effective maps in an \\nefficient manner. Defining features and attributes of interest is often an iterative process of trial and error. \\nBeing able to associate a feature with a particular geometric form and to determine the fea ture type are \\ncentral to map abstraction, facilitate mapping, and the application of GISs.  \\nMap Content and Generalization \\nThe shape and content of maps vary according to purpose, need, and resources, among other factors. \\nWhat is common to most maps, and in particular to those within a GIS, is that they are graphical \\nrepresentations of reality. Put another way, various graphical symbols are used to represent geographical \\nfeatures or entities. Annotation or text is also commonly used on maps and facilitates m ap interpretation. \\nLearning about map content and map generalization is important because they serve as the building \\nblocks for spatial data that are used within a GIS. \\nBuilding upon the previous discussion about the geometric form of geographic features, maps typically \\nrely on three geometric objects: the point, the line, and the polygon or area. A point is defined \\nby x and y coordinates, a line is defined by two points, and a polygon is defined by a minimum of three \\npoints. The important thing to note is that the definition of a point is analogous to a location that is \\ndefined by longitude and latitude. Furthermore, since lines and polygons are made up of points, location \\ninformation (i.e., x and y, or longitude and latitude, coordinates) is intrinsic to points, lines, and polygons. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  55 \\nFigure 2.14 Geographic Features as Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nBoth simple and complex maps can be made using these three relatively simple geometric objects. \\nAdditionally, by changing the graphical characteristics of each object, an infinite number of mapping \\npossibilities emerge. Such changes can be made to the respective size, shape, color, and patterns of points, \\nlines, and polygons. For instance, different sized points can be used to reflect variations in population \\nsize, line color or line size (i.e., thickness) can be used to denote volume or the amount of interaction \\nbetween locations, and different colors and shapes can be used to reflect different values of interest.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  56 \\nFigure 2.15 Variations in the Graphical Parameters of Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nFigure 2.16 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  57 \\nComplementing the graphical elements described previously is annotation or text. Annotation is used to \\nidentify particular geographic features, such as cities, states, bodies of water, or other points of i nterest. \\nLike the graphical elements, text can be varied according to size, orientation, or color. There are also \\nnumerous text fonts and styles that are incorporated into maps. For example, bodies of water are often \\nlabeled in italics. \\nAnother map element that deserves to be mentioned and that combines both graphics and text is the map \\nlegend or map key. A map legend provides users information about the how geographic information is \\nrepresented graphically. Legends usually consist of a title that describes the map, as well as the various \\nsymbols, colors, and patterns that are used on the map. Such information is often vital to the proper \\ninterpretation of a map. \\nAs more features and graphical elements are put on a given map, the need to generalize such feat ures \\narises. Map generalization refers to the process of resolving conflicts associated with too much detail, too \\nmany features, or too much information to map. In particular, generalization can take several forms \\n(Buttenfield and McMaster 1991): [2] \\n\u2022 The simplification or symbolization of features for emphasis \\n\u2022 The masking or displacement of detail to increase clarity or legibility  \\n\u2022 The selection of detail for inclusion or omission from the map \\n\u2022 The exaggeration of features for emphasis \\nDetermining which aspects of generalization to use is largely a matter of personal preference, experience, \\nmap purpose, and trial and error. Though there are general guidelines about map generalization, there are \\nno universal standards or requirements with regard to the generalization of maps and mapping. It is at \\nthis point that cartographic and artistic license, prejudices and biases, and creativity and design sense \u2014 or \\nlack thereof\u2014 emerge to shape the map. \\nMaking a map and, more generally, the process of mapping involve a range of decisions and choices. From \\nthe selection of the appropriate map scale and map projection to deciding which features to map and to \\nomit, mapping is a complex blend of art and science. In fact, many historical maps are indeed viewed like \\nworks of art, and rightly so. Learning about the scale, shape, and content of maps serves to increase our Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  58 \\nunderstanding of maps, as well as deepen our appreciation of maps and map making. Ultimately, this \\nincreased geographical awareness and appreciation of maps promotes the sound and effective use and \\napplication of a GIS. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map abstraction refers to the process of explicitly defining and representing real -world features on a \\nmap. \\n\u2022 The three basic geometric forms of geographical features are the point, line, a nd polygon (or area). \\n\u2022 Map generalization refers to resolving conflicts that arise on a map due to limited space, too many \\ndetails, or too much information. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Not long ago, such image maps from satellites were the sole domain of \\nmeteorologists, local weather forecasters, and various government agencies. Public access to such images \\nwas pretty much limited to the evening news. \\nTechnological advances in imaging technology, in conjunction with the commercialization of space flight, \\nopened the door for companies like GeoEye (http://www.geoeye.com) and DigitalGlobe \\n(http://www.digitalglobe.com) to provide satellite imagery and maps to the masses at the turn of the \\ntwenty-first century.

What\u2019s more is that \\nthe process of mapping has also been decentralized and democratized so that many more people not \\nonly have access to maps but also are enabled and empowered to create their own maps. This \\ndemocratization of maps and mapping is in large part attributable to a shift to digital map \\nproduction and consumption. Unlike analog or hardcopy maps that are static or fixed once they are \\nprinted onto paper, digital maps are highly changeable, exchangeable, and as noted in Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", dynamic in terms of scale, form, and content. \\nTo understand digital maps and mapping, it is necessary to put them into the context of computing \\nand information technology. First, this chapter provides an introduction to the building blocks of \\ndigital maps and geographic information systems (GISs), with particular emphasis placed upon how \\ndata and information are stored as files on a computer. Second, key issues and considerations as they \\nrelate to data acquisition and data standards are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion \\nof where data for use with a GIS can be found. This chapter serves as the bridge between the \\nconceptual materials presented in Chapter 1 \"Introduction\" and Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\"and the \\nchapters that follow, which contain more formal discussions about the use and application of a GIS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  61 \\n3.1 Data and Information \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to define and describe data and information and how it is organized into \\nfiles for use in a computing and geographic information system (GIS) environment.  \\nTo understand how we get from analog to digital maps, let\u2019s begin with the building blocks and \\nfoundations of the geographic information system (GIS)\u2014 namely, data and information. As already \\nnoted on several occasions, GIS stores, edits, processes, and presents data and information. But what \\nexactly is data? And what exactly is information? For many, the terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d refer \\nto the same thing. For our purposes, it is useful to make a distinction between the two. \\nGenerally, data refer to facts, measurements, characteristics, or traits of an object of interest. For \\nyou grammar sticklers out there, note that \u201cdata\u201d is the plural form of \u201cdatum.\u201d For example, we can \\ncollect all kinds of data about all kinds of things, like the length of rainbow trout in a Colorado \\nstream, the number of vegetarians in Alaska, the diameter of mahogany tree trunks in the Brazilian \\nrainforest, student scores on the last GIS midterm, the altitude of mountain peaks in Nepal, the \\ndepth of snow in the Austrian Alps, or the number of people who use public transportation to get to \\nwork in London. \\nOnce data are put into context, used to answer questions, situated within analytical frameworks, or \\nused to obtain insights, they become information. For our purposes, information simply refers to \\nthe knowledge of value obtained through the collection, interpretation, and/or analysis of data. \\nThough a computer is not necessary to collect, record, manipulate, process, or visualize data, or to \\nprocess it into information, information technology can be of great help. For instance, computers can \\nautomate repetitive tasks, store data efficiently in terms of space and cost, and provide a range of \\ntools for analyzing data from spreadsheets to GISs, of course. What\u2019s more is the fact that the \\nincredible amount of data collected each and every day by satellites, grocery store product scanners, \\ntraffic sensors, temperature gauges, and your mobile phone carrier, to name just a few, would not be \\npossible without the aid and innovation of information technology. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  62 \\nSince this is a text about GISs, it is useful to also define geographic data. Like generic \\ndata, geographic or spatial data refer to geographic facts, measurements, or characteristics of an \\nobject that permit us to define its location on the surface of the earth. Such data include but are not \\nrestricted to the latitude and longitude coordinates of points of interest, street addresses, postal \\ncodes, political boundaries, and even the names of places of interest. It is also important to note and \\nreemphasize the difference between geographic data and attribute data, which was discussed \\nin Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". Where geographic data are concerned with defining the location of an \\nobject of interest, attribute data are concerned with its nongeographic traits and characteristics. \\nTo illustrate the distinction between geographic and attribute data, think about your home where \\nyou grew up or where you currently live. Within the context of this discussion, we can associate both \\ngeographic and attribute data to it. For instance, we can define the location of your home many ways, \\nsuch as with a street address, the street names of the nearest intersection, the postal code where your \\nhome is located, or we could use a global positioning system\u2013enabled device to obtain latitude and \\nlongitude coordinates. What is important is geographic data permit us to define the location of an \\nobject (i.e., your home) on the surface of the earth. \\nIn addition to the geographic data that define the location of your home are the attribute data that \\ndescribe the various qualities of your home. Such data include but are not restricted to the number of \\nbedrooms and bathrooms in your home, whether or not your home has central heat, the year when \\nyour home was built, the number of occupants, and whether or not there is a swimming pool. These \\nattribute data tell us a lot about your home but relatively little about where it is. \\nNot only is it useful to recognize and understand how geographic and attribute data differ and \\ncomplement each other, but it is also of central importance when learning about and using GISs. \\nBecause a GIS requires and integrates these two distinct types of data, being able to differentiate \\nbetween geographic and attribute data is the first step in organizing your GIS. Furthermore, being \\nable to determine which kinds of data you need will ultimately aid in your implementation and use of \\na GIS. More often than not, and in the age and context of information technology, the data and \\ninformation discussed thus far is the stuff of computer files, which are the focus of the next section. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  63 \\nOf Files and Formats\u2026 \\nWhen we collect data about your home, rainforests, or anything, really, we usually need to put them \\nsomewhere. Though we may scribble numbers and measures on the back of an envelope or write them \\ndown on a pad of paper, if we want to update, share, analyze, or map them in the future, it is often useful \\nto record them in digital form so a computer can read them. Though we won\u2019t bother ourselves with the \\nbits and bytes of computing, it is necessary to discuss some basic elements of computing that are both \\nrelevant and required when learning and working with a GIS. \\nOne of the most common elements of working with computers and computing itself is the file. Files in a \\ncomputer can contain any number of things from a complex set of instructions (e.g., a computer program) \\nto a list of numbers and letters (e.g., address book). Furthermore, computer files come in all different sizes \\nand types. One of the clues we can use to distinguish one file from another is the file extension. The file \\nextension refers to the letters that follow the period (\u201c.\u201d) after the name of the file. Table 3.1 contains some \\nof the most common file extensions and the types of files with which they are associated.  \\nTable 3.1 \\nfilename.txt Simple text file \\nfilename.doc Microsoft Word document \\nfilename.pdf Adobe portable document format \\nfilename.jpg Compressed image file \\nfilename.tif Tagged image format \\nfilename.html Hypertext markup language (used to create web pages) \\nfilename.xml Extensible markup language \\nfilename.zip Zipped/compressed archive \\nSome computer programs may be able to read or work with only certain file types, while others are more \\nadept at reading multiple file formats. What you will realize as you begin to work  more with information \\ntechnology, and GISs in particular, is that familiarity with different file types is important. Learning how \\nto convert or export one file type to another is also a very useful and valuable skill to obtain. In this \\nregard, being able to recognize and knowing how to identify different and unfamiliar file types will \\nundoubtedly increase your proficiency with computers and GISs. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  64 \\nOf the numerous file types that exist, one of the most common and widely accessed file is the simple \\ntext, plain text, or just text file. Simple text files can be read widely by word processing programs, \\nspreadsheet and database programs, and web browsers. Often ending with the extension \u201c.txt\u201d \\n(i.e.,filename.txt), text files contain no special formatting (e.g., bold, italic, underlining) and contain only \\nalphanumeric characters. In other words, images or complex graphics are not well suited for text files. \\nText files, however, are ideal for recording, sharing, and exchanging data because most computers and \\noperating systems can recognize and read simple text files with programs called text editors.  \\nWhen a text file contains data that are organized or structured in some fashion, it is sometimes called a \\nflat file (but the file extension remains the same, i.e., .txt). Generally, flat files are organized in a tabular \\nformat or line by line. In other words, each line or row of the file contains one and only one record. So if \\nwe collected height measurements on three people, Tim, Jake, and Harry, the file might look som ething \\nlike this: \\nName Height \\nTim 6\u20191\u201d \\nJake 5\u20199\u201d \\nHarry 6\u20192\u201d \\nEach row corresponds to one and only one record, observation or case. There are two other important \\nelements to know about this file. First, note that the first row does not contain any data; rather, it provides \\na description of the data contained in each column. When the first row of a file contains such descriptors, \\nit is referred to as a header row or just a header. Columns in a flat file are also called \\nfields, variables, or attributes. \u201cHeight\u201d is the attribute, field, or variable that we are interested in, and \\nthe observations or cases in our data set are \u201cTim,\u201d \u201cJake,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d In short, rows are for records; \\ncolumns are for fields. \\nThe second unseen but critical element to the file is the spaces in between each column or field. In the \\nexample, it appears as though a space separates the \u201cname\u201d column from the \u201cheight\u201d column. Upon \\ncloser inspection, however, note how the initial values of the \u201cheight\u201d column are aligned. If a single space \\nwas being used to separate each column, the height column would not be aligned. In this case a tab is \\nbeing used to separate the columns of each row. The character that is used to separate columns within a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  65 \\nflat file is called the delimiter or separator. Though any character can be used as a delimiter, the most \\ncommon delimiters are the tab, the comma, and a single space. The following are examples of each.  \\nTab-Delimited Single-Space-Delimited Comma-Delimited \\nName     Height Name Height Name, Height \\nTim     6.1 Tim 6.1 Tim, 6.1 \\nJake     5.9 Jake 5.9 Jake, 5.9 \\nHarry     6.2 Harry 6.2 Harry, 6.2 \\nKnowing the delimiter to a flat file is important because it enables us to distinguish and separate the \\ncolumns efficiently and without error. Sometimes such files are referred to by their delimiter, such as a \\n\u201ccomma-separated values\u201d file or a \u201ctab-delimited\u201d file. \\nWhen recording and working with geographic data, the same general format is applied. Rows are reserved \\nfor records, or in the case of geographic data, locations and columns or fields are used for the attributes or \\nvariables associated with each location. For example, the following tab-delimited flat file contains data for \\nthree places (i.e., countries) and three attributes or characteristics of eac h country (i.e., population, \\nlanguage, continent) as noted by the header. \\nCountry Population Language Continent \\nFrance 65,000,000 French Europe \\nBrazil 192,000,000 Portuguese South America \\nAustralia 22,000,000 English Australia \\nFiles like those presented here are the building blocks of the various tables, charts, reports, graphs, and \\nother visualizations that we see each and every day online, in print, and on television. They are also key \\ncomponents to the maps and geographic representations created by GISs. Rarely if ever, however, will you \\nwork with one and only one file or file type. More often than not, and especially when working with GISs, \\nyou will work with multiple files. Such a grouping of multiple files is called a  database. Since the files \\nwithin a database may be different sizes, shapes, and even formats, we need to devise some type of system \\nthat will allow us to work, update, edit, integrate, share, and display the various data within the database. \\nSuch a system is generally referred to as a database management system (DBMS). Databases and DBMSs \\nare so important to GISs that a later chapter is dedicated to them. For now it is enough to remember that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  66 \\nfile types are like ice cream\u2014 they come in all different kinds of flavors. In light of such variety, Section 3.2 \\n\"Data about Data\" details some of the key issues that need to be considered when acquiring and working \\nwith data and information for GISs. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Data refer to specific facts, measurements, or characteristics of objects and phenomena of interest.  \\n\u2022 Information refers to knowledge of value that is obtained from the analysis of data.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the difference between primary and secondary data sources \\nand to understand the importance of metadata and data standards.  \\nConsider the following comma-delimited file: \\ncity, sun, temp, precip \\nLos Angeles, 300, 70, 10 \\nLondon, 50, 55, 40 \\nSingapore, 330, 80, 60 \\nLooking at the contents of the file, we can see that it contains data about the cities of Los Angeles, \\nLondon, and Singapore. As noted, each field or attribute is separated by a comma, and the file also \\ncontains a header row that tells us about the data contained in each column. Or does it? What does \\nthe column \u201csun\u201d refer to? Is it the number of sunny days this year, last year, annually, or when? \\nWhat about \u201ctemp\u201d? Does this refer to the average daytime, evening, or annual temperature? For \\nthat matter, how is temperature measured? In Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin? The column \u201cprecip\u201d \\nprobably refers to precipitation, but again, what are the units or time frame for such measures and \\ndata? Finally, where did these data come from? Who collected them, when were they collected and \\nfor what purpose? \\nIt is amazing to think that such a small text file can lead to so many questions. Now let\u2019s extend the \\nexample to a file with one hundred records on ten variables, one thousand records on one hundred \\nvariables or better yet, ten thousand records on one thousand variables. Through this rather simple \\nexample, a number of general but central issues that are related to data emerge. Such issues range \\nfrom the relatively mundane naming conventions that are used to identify individual records (i.e., \\nrows) and distinguish one field (i.e., column) from another, to the issue of providing documentation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  68 \\nabout what data are included in a given file; when the data were collected; for what purpose are the \\ndata to be used; who collected them; and, of course, where did the data come from? \\nThe previous simple text file illustrates how we cannot and should not take data and information for \\ngranted. It also highlights two important concepts with regard to the source of data and to the \\ncontents of data files. With regard to data sources, data can be put into one of two distinct categories. \\nThe first category is called primary data. Primary data refer to data that are collected directly or on a \\nfirsthand basis. For example, if you wanted to examine the variability of local temperatures in the \\nmonth of May, and you recorded the temperature at noon every day in May, you would be \\nconstructing a primary data set. Conversely, secondary data refer to data collected by someone else or \\nsome other party. For instance, when we work with census or economic data collected and \\ndistributed by the government, we are using secondary data. \\nSeveral factors influence the decision behind the construction and use of primary data sets versus \\nsecondary data sets. Among the most important factors are the costs associated with data acquisition \\nin terms of money, availability, and time. In fact, the data acquisition and integration phase of most \\ngeographic information system (GIS) projects is often the most time consuming. In other words, \\nlocating, obtaining, and putting together the data to be used for a GIS project, whether you collect \\nthe data yourself or use secondary data, may indeed take up most of your time. Of course, depending \\non the purpose, availability, and need, it may not be necessary to construct an entirely new data set \\n(i.e., primary data set). In light of the vast amounts of data and information that are publicly \\navailable, for example, via the Internet, the cost and time savings of using secondary data often offset \\nany benefits that are associated with primary data collection. \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of the difference between primary and secondary data, as \\nwell as the rationale behind each, how do we go about finding the data and information that we \\nneed? As noted earlier, there is an incredibly vast and growing amount of data and information \\navailable to us, and performing an online search for \u201cdeforestation data\u201d will return hundreds\u2014 if not \\nthousands\u2014 of results. To overcome this data and information overload we need to turn to\u2026even \\nmore data. In particular, we are looking for a special kind of data called metadata. Simply defined, \\nmetadata are data about data. At one level, a header row in a simple text file like those discussed in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  69 \\nthe previous section is analogous to metadata. The header row provides data (e.g., names and labels) \\nabout the subsequent rows of data. \\nHeader rows themselves, however, may need additional explanation as previously illustrated. \\nFurthermore, when working with or searching through several data sets, it can be quite tedious at \\nbest or impossible at worst to open each and every file in order to determine its contents and \\nusability. Enter metadata. Today many files, and in particular secondary data sets, come with a \\nmetadata file. These metadata files contain items such as general descriptions about the contents of \\nthe file, definitions for the various terms used to identify records (rows) and fields (fields), the range \\nof values for fields, the quality or reliability of the data and measurements, how the data were \\ncollected, when the data were collected, and who collected the data. Though not all data are \\naccompanied by metadata, it is easy to see and understand why metadata are important and valuable \\nwhen searching for secondary data, as well as when constructing primary data that may be shared in \\nthe future. \\nJust as simple files come in all shapes, sizes, and formats, so too do metadata. As the amount and \\navailability of data and information increase each and every day, metadata play a critical role in \\nmaking sense of it all. The class of metadata that we are most concerned with when working with a \\nGIS is calledgeospatial metadata. As the name suggests, geospatial metadata are data about \\ngeographical and spatial data. According to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in the \\nUnited States (see http://www.fgdc.gov), \u201cGeospatial metadata are used to document geographic \\ndigital resources such as GIS files, geospatial databases, and earth imagery. A geospatial metadata \\nrecord includes core library catalog elements such as Title, Abstract, and Publication Data; \\ngeographic elements such as Geographic Extent and Projection Information; and database elements \\nsuch as Attribute Label Definitions and Attribute Domain Values.\u201d The definition of geospatial \\nmetadata is about improving transparency when it comes to data, as well as promoting standards. \\nTake a few moments to explore and examine the contents of a geospatial metadata file that conforms \\nto the FGDC here. \\nGenerally, standards refer to widely promoted, accepted, and followed rules and practices. Given the \\nrange and variability of data and data sources, identifying a common thread to locate and understand Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  70 \\nthe contents of any given file can be a challenge. Just as the rules of grammar and mathematics \\nprovide the foundations for communication and numeric calculations, respectively, metadata \\nprovide similar frameworks for working with and sharing data and information from various \\nsources. \\nThe central point behind metadata is that it facilitates data and information sharing. Within the \\ncontext of large organizations such as governments, data and information sharing can eliminate \\nredundancies and increase efficiencies. Moreover, access to data and information promotes the \\nintegration of different data that can improve analyses, inform decisions, and shape policy. The role \\nthat metadata\u2014 and in particular geospatial metadata\u2014 play in the world of GISs is critical and offers \\nenormous benefits in terms of cost and time savings. It is precisely the sharing, widespread \\ndistribution and integration of various geographic and nongeographic data and information, enabled \\nby metadata, that drive some of the most interesting and compelling innovations in GISs and the \\nbroader geospatial information technology community. More important, widespread access, \\ndistribution, and sharing of geographic data and information have important social costs and \\nbenefits and yield better analyses and more informed decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Primary data refer to data that are obtained via direct observation or measure, and secondary data refer \\nto data collected by a different party. \\n\u2022 Data acquisition is among the most time-consuming aspects of any GIS project. \\n\u2022 Metadata are data about data and promote data exchange, dissemination, and integration.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the costs and benefits of using primary data instead of secondary data?  \\n2. Refer to the Federal Geographic Data Committee website (http://www.fgdc.gov) and describe in detail \\nwhat information should be included in a metadata file. Why are metadata and standards important?  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  71 \\n3.3 Finding Data \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to identify and evaluate key considerations when searching for data.  \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of data and information, where can we find such data and \\ninformation? Though an Internet search will certainly come up with myriad sources and types of \\ndata, the hunt for relevant and useful data is often a challenging and iterative process. Therefore, \\nprior to hopping online and downloading the first thing that appears from a web search, it is useful \\nto frame our search for data with the following questions and considerations: \\n1. What exactly is the purpose of the data? Given the fact the world is swimming in va st amounts of \\ndata, articulating why we need (or why we don\u2019t need) a given set of data will streamline the \\nsearch for useful and relevant data. To this end, the more specific we can be about the purpose of \\nthe needed data, the more efficient our search for data will be. For example, if we are interested in \\nunderstanding and studying economic growth, it is useful to determine both temporal and \\ngeographic scales. In other words, for what time periods (e.g., 1850 \u20131900) and intervals (e.g., \\nquarterly, annually) are we interested, and at what level of analysis (e.g., national, regional, \\nstate)? Oftentimes, data availability, or more specifically, the lack of relevant data, will force us to \\nchange the purpose or scope of our original question. A clear purpose will yield a more efficient \\nsearch for data and enables us to accept or discard quickly the various data sets that we may come \\nacross. \\n2. The second question we need to ask ourselves is what data already exist and to what data do we \\nhave access already? Prior to searching for new data, it is always a good idea to take an inventory \\nof the data that we already have. Such data may be from previous projects or analyses, or from \\ncolleagues and classmates, but the key point here is that we can save a lot of time and ef fort by \\nusing data that we already possess. Furthermore, by identifying what we have, we get a better \\nunderstanding of what we need. For instance, though we may already have census data (i.e., \\nattribute data), we may need updated geographic data that conta ins the boundaries of US states \\nor counties. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  72 \\n3. Next, we need to assess and evaluate the costs associated with data acquisition. Data acquisition \\ncosts go beyond financial costs. Just as important as the financial costs to data are those that \\ninvolve your time. After all, time is money. The time and energy you spend on collecting, finding, \\ncleaning, and formatting data are time and energy taken away from data analysis. Depending on \\ndeadlines, time constraints, and deliverables, it is critical to learn how to m anage your time when \\nlooking for data. \\n4. Finally, the format of the data that is needed is of critical importance. Though many programs can \\nread many formats of data, there are some data types that can only be read by some programs and \\nsome programs that require particular data formats. Understanding what data formats you can \\nuse and those that you cannot will aid in your search for data. For instance, one of the most \\ncommon forms of geographic information system (GIS) data is called the  shapefile. Not all GIS \\nprograms can read or use shapefiles, but it may be necessary to convert to or from a shapefile or \\nsome other format. Hence, as noted earlier, the more data formats with which we are familiar, the \\nbetter off we will be in our search for data because we will have an understanding of not only what \\nwe can use but also what format conversions will need to be made if necessary.  \\nAll these questions are of equal importance and being able to answer them will assist in a more \\nefficient and effective search for data. Obviously, there are several other considerations behind the \\nsearch for data, and in particular GIS data, but those listed here provide an initial pathway to a \\nsuccessful search for data. \\nAs information technology evolves, and as more and more data are collected and distributed, the \\nvarious forms of data that can be used with a GIS increases. Generally, and as discussed previously, a \\nGIS uses and integrates two types of data: geographic data and attribute data. Sometimes the source \\nof both geographic and attribute data are one in the same. For instance, the US Bureau of Census \\n(http://www.census.gov) distributes geographic boundary files (e.g., census tract level, county level, \\nstate level) as well as the associated attribute data (e.g., population, race/ethnicity, income). What\u2019s \\nmore is that such data are freely available at no charge. In many respects, US census data are \\nexceptional: they are free and comprehensive. If only all data were free and comprehensive! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  73 \\nObviously, each and every search for data will vary according to purpose, but data from governments \\ntend to have good coverage and provide a point of reference from which other data can be added, \\ncompared, and evaluated. Whether you need satellite imagery data from the National Aeronautics \\nand Space Administration (http://www.nasa.gov) or land use data from the United States Geological \\nSurvey (http://www.usgs.gov), such government sources tend to be reliable, reputable, and \\nconsistent. Another key element of most government data is that they are freely accessible to the \\npublic. In other words, there is no charge to use or to acquire the data. Data that are free to use are \\ngenerally called public data. \\nUnlike publicly available data, there are numerous sources of private or proprietary data. The main \\ndifference between public and private data is that the former tend to be free, and the latter must be \\nacquired at a cost. Furthermore, there are often restrictions on the redistribution and dissemination \\nof proprietary data sets (i.e., sharing the purchased data is not allowed). Again, depending on the \\nsubject matter, proprietary data may be the only option. Another reason for using proprietary data is \\nthat the data may be formatted and cleaned according to your needs. The trade-off between financial \\ncost and time saved is one that must be seriously considered and evaluated when working with \\ndeadlines. \\nThe search for data, and in particular the data that you need, is often the most time consuming \\naspect of any GIS-related project. Therefore, it is critical to try to define and clarify your data \\nrequirements and needs\u2014 from the temporal and geographic scales of data to the formats required\u2014\\nas clearly as possible and as early as possible. Such definition and clarity will pay dividends in your \\nsearch for the right data, which in turn will yield better analyses and well-informed decisions. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n\u2022 Prior to searching for data, ask yourself the following questions: Why do I need the data? At what time \\nscale do I need the data? At what geographic scale do I want the data? What data already exist?

The objective of this section is to understand how raster data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nThe raster data model is widely used in applications ranging far beyond geographic information \\nsystems (GISs). Most likely, you are already very familiar with this data model if you have any \\nexperience with digital photographs. The ubiquitous JPEG, BMP, and TIFF file formats (among \\nothers) are based on the raster data model (see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section \\n5.3 \"File Formats\"). Take a moment to view your favorite digital image. If you zoom deeply into the \\nimage, you will notice that it is composed of an array of tiny square pixels (or picture elements). Each \\nof these uniquely colored pixels, when viewed as a whole, combines to form a coherent image (Figure \\n4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nFigure 4.1 Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image \\n \\nFurthermore, all liquid crystal display (LCD) computer monitors are based on raster technology as \\nthey are composed of a set number of rows and columns of pixels. Notably, the foundation of this \\ntechnology predates computers and digital cameras by nearly a century. The neoimpressionist artist, \\nGeorges Seurat, developed a painting technique referred to as \u201cpointillism\u201d in the 1880s, which \\nsimilarly relies on the amassing of small, monochromatic \u201cdots\u201d of ink that combine to form a larger \\nimage (Figure 4.2 \"Pointillist Artwork\"). If you are as generous as the author, you may indeed think \\nof your raster dataset creations as sublime works of art. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  77 \\nFigure 4.2 Pointillist Artwork \\n \\nThe raster data model consists of rows and columns of equally sized pixels interconnected to form a \\nplanar surface. These pixels are used as building blocks for creating points, lines, areas, networks, \\nand surfaces (Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Figure 2.6 \"Map Overlay Process\" illustrates how a land \\nparcel can be converted to a raster representation). Although pixels may be triangles, hexagons, or \\neven octagons, square pixels represent the simplest geometric form with which to work. Accordingly, \\nthe vast majority of available raster GIS data are built on the square pixel (Figure 4.3 \"Common \\nRaster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and USGS DEM (right)\"). These \\nsquares are typically reformed into rectangles of various dimensions if the data model is transformed \\nfrom one projection to another (e.g., from State Plane coordinates to UTM [Universal Transverse \\nMercator] coordinates). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  78 \\nFigure 4.3 Common Raster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and \\nUSGS DEM (right) \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nBecause of the reliance on a uniform series of square pixels, the raster data model is referred to as a \\ngrid-based system. Typically, a single data value will be assigned to each grid locale. Each cell in a \\nraster carries a single value, which represents the characteristic of the spatial phenomenon at a \\nlocation denoted by its row and column. The data type for that cell value can be either integer or \\nfloating-point (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1 \"Geographic Data \\nAcquisition\"). Alternatively, the raster graphic can reference a database management system wherein \\nopen-ended attribute tables can be used to associate multiple data values to each pixel. The advance \\nof computer technology has made this second methodology increasingly feasible as large datasets are \\nno longer constrained by computer storage issues as they were previously. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  79 \\nThe raster model will average all values within a given pixel to yield a single value. Therefore, the \\nmore area covered per pixel, the less accurate the associated data values. The area covered by each \\npixel determines thespatial resolution of the raster model from which it is derived. Specifically, \\nresolution is determined by measuring one side of the square pixel. A raster model with pixels \\nrepresenting 10 m by 10 m (or 100 square meters) in the real world would be said to have a spatial \\nresolution of 10 m; a raster model with pixels measuring 1 km by 1 km (1 square kilometer) in the \\nreal world would be said to have a spatial resolution of 1 km; and so forth. \\nCare must be taken when determining the resolution of a raster because using an overly coarse pixel \\nresolution will cause a loss of information, whereas using overly fine pixel resolution will result in \\nsignificant increases in file size and computer processing requirements during display and/or \\nanalysis. An effective pixel resolution will take both the map scale and the minimum mapping unit of \\nthe other GIS data into consideration. In the case of raster graphics with coarse spatial resolution, \\nthe data values associated with specific locations are not necessarily explicit in the raster data model. \\nFor example, if the location of telephone poles were mapped on a coarse raster graphic, it would be \\nclear that the entire cell would not be filled by the pole. Rather, the pole would be assumed to be \\nlocated somewhere within that cell (typically at the center). \\nImagery employing the raster data model must exhibit several properties. First, each pixel must hold \\nat least one value, even if that data value is zero. Furthermore, if no data are present for a given pixel, \\na data value placeholder must be assigned to this grid cell. Often, an arbitrary, readily identifiable \\nvalue (e.g., \u22129999) will be assigned to pixels for which there is no data value. Second, a cell can hold \\nany alphanumeric index that represents an attribute. In the case of quantitative datasets, attribute \\nassignation is fairly straightforward. For example, if a raster image denotes elevation, the data values \\nfor each pixel would be some indication of elevation, usually in feet or meters. In the case of \\nqualitative datasets, data values are indices that necessarily refer to some predetermined \\ntranslational rule. In the case of a land-use/land-cover raster graphic, the following rule may be \\napplied: 1 = grassland, 2 = agricultural, 3 = disturbed, and so forth (Figure 4.4 \"Land-Use/Land-\\nCover Raster Image\"). The third property of the raster data model is that points and lines \u201cmove\u201d to \\nthe center of the cell. As one might expect, if a 1 km resolution raster image contains a river or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  80 \\nstream, the location of the actual waterway within the \u201criver\u201d pixel will be unclear. Therefore, there is \\na general assumption that all zero-dimensional (point) and one-dimensional (line) features will be \\nlocated toward the center of the cell. As a corollary, the minimum width for any line feature must \\nnecessarily be one cell regardless of the actual width of the feature. If it is not, the feature will not be \\nrepresented in the image and will therefore be assumed to be absent. \\nFigure 4.4 Land-Use/Land-Cover Raster Image \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  81 \\nSeveral methods exist for encoding raster data from scratch. Three of these models are as follows: \\n1. Cell-by-cell raster encoding. This minimally intensive method encodes a raster by creating \\nrecords for each cell value by row and column (Figure 4.5 \"Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThis method could be thought of as a large spreadsheet wherein each cell of the spreadsheet \\nrepresents a pixel in the raster image. This method is also referred to as \u201cexhaustive \\nenumeration.\u201d \\n2. Run-length raster encoding. This method encodes cell values in runs of similarly valued pixels \\nand can result in a highly compressed image file (Figure 4.6 \"Run-Length Encoding of Raster \\nData\"). The run-length encoding method is useful in situations where large groups of neighboring \\npixels have similar values (e.g., discrete datasets such as land use/land cover or habitat \\nsuitability) and is less useful where neighboring pixel values vary widely (e.g., continuous datasets \\nsuch as elevation or sea-surface temperatures). \\n3. Quad-tree raster encoding. This method divides a raster into a hierarchy of quadrants that are \\nsubdivided based on similarly valued pixels (Figure 4.7 \"Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThe division of the raster stops when a quadrant is made entirely from cells of the same value. A \\nquadrant that cannot be subdivided is called a \u201cleaf node.\u201d \\nFigure 4.5 Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  82 \\nFigure 4.6 Run-Length Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  83 \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Raster Model \\nThe use of a raster data model confers many advantages. First, the technology required to create raster \\ngraphics is inexpensive and ubiquitous. Nearly everyone currently owns some sort of raster image \\ngenerator, namely a digital camera, and few cellular phones are sold today that don\u2019t include such \\nfunctionality. Similarly, a plethora of satellites are constantly beaming up -to-the-minute raster graphics \\nto scientific facilities across the globe (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3 \"File \\nFormats\"). These graphics are often posted online for private and/or public use, occasionally at no cost to \\nthe user. \\nAdditional advantages of raster graphics are the relative simplicity of the underlying data structure. Each \\ngrid location represented in the raster image correlates to a single value (or series of values if attributes \\ntables are included). This simple data structure may also help explain why it is relatively easy to perform \\noverlay analyses on raster data (for more on overlay analyses, see Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector \\nOperations\", Section 7.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\"). This simplicity also lends itself to easy interpretation \\nand maintenance of the graphics, relative to its vector counterpart.  \\nDespite the advantages, there are also several disadvantages to using the raster data model. The first \\ndisadvantage is that raster files are typically very large. Particu larly in the case of raster images built from \\nthe cell-by-cell encoding methodology, the sheer number of values stored for a given dataset result in \\npotentially enormous files. Any raster file that covers a large area and has somewhat finely resolved pixel s \\nwill quickly reach hundreds of megabytes in size or more. These large files are only getting larger as the \\nquantity and quality of raster datasets continues to keep pace with quantity and quality of computer \\nresources and raster data collectors (e.g., digital cameras, satellites). \\nA second disadvantage of the raster model is that the output images are less \u201cpretty\u201d than their vector \\ncounterparts. This is particularly noticeable when the raster images are enlarged or zoomed (refer \\nto Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\" ). Depending on how \\nfar one zooms into a raster image, the details and coherence of that image will quickly be lost amid a \\npixilated sea of seemingly randomly colored grid cells. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  84 \\nThe geometric transformations that arise during map reprojection efforts can cause problems for raster \\ngraphics and represent a third disadvantage to using the raster data model. As described in  Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.2 \"Map Scale, Coordinate Systems, and Map Projections\", changing map \\nprojections will alter the size and shape of the original input layer and frequently result in the loss or \\naddition of pixels (White 2006). [1] These alterations will result in the perfect square pixels of the input \\nlayer taking on some alternate rhomboidal dimensions. However, the problem is larger than a simple \\nreformation of the square pixel. Indeed, the reprojection of a raster image dataset from one projection to \\nanother brings change to pixel values that may, in turn, significantly alter the output information (Seong \\n2003). [2] \\nThe final disadvantage of using the raster data model is that it is not suitable for some types of spatial \\nanalyses. For example, difficulties arise when attempting to overlay and analyze multiple raster  graphics \\nproduced at differing scales and pixel resolutions. Combining information from a raster image with 10 m \\nspatial resolution with a raster image with 1 km spatial resolution will most likely produce nonsensical \\noutput information as the scales of analysis are far too disparate to result in meaningful and/or \\ninterpretable conclusions. In addition, some network and spatial analyses (i.e., determining directionality \\nor geocoding) can be problematic to perform on raster data. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Raster data are derived from a grid-based system of contiguous cells containing specific attribute \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The spatial resolution of a raster dataset represents a measure of the accuracy or detail of the displayed \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The raster data model is widely used by non-GIS technologies such as digital cameras/pictures and LCD \\nmonitors. \\n\u2022 Care should be taken to determine whether the raster or vector data model is best suited for your data \\nand/or analytical needs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how vector data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nIn contrast to the raster data model is the vector data model. In this model, space is not quantized \\ninto discrete grid cells like the raster model. Vector data models use points and their associated X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs to represent the vertices of spatial features, much as if they were being drawn on a \\nmap by hand (Aronoff 1989). [1] The data attributes of these features are then stored in a separate \\ndatabase management system. The spatial information and the attribute information for these \\nmodels are linked via a simple identification number that is given to each feature in a map. \\nThree fundamental vector types exist in geographic information systems (GISs): points, lines, and \\npolygons (Figure 4.8 \"Points, Lines, and Polygons\"). Points are zero-dimensional objects that contain \\nonly a single coordinate pair. Points are typically used to model singular, discrete features such as \\nbuildings, wells, power poles, sample locations, and so forth. Points have only the property of \\nlocation. Other types of point features include the node and the vertex. Specifically, a point is a stand-\\nalone feature, while a node is a topological junction representing a common X, Y coordinate pair \\nbetween intersecting lines and/or polygons. Vertices are defined as each bend along a line or polygon \\nfeature that is not the intersection of lines or polygons. \\nFigure 4.8 Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  87 \\nPoints can be spatially linked to form more complex features. Lines are one-dimensional features \\ncomposed of multiple, explicitly connected points. Lines are used to represent linear features such as \\nroads, streams, faults, boundaries, and so forth. Lines have the property of length. Lines that directly \\nconnect two nodes are sometimes referred to as chains, edges, segments, or arcs. \\nPolygons are two-dimensional features created by multiple lines that loop back to create a \u201cclosed\u201d \\nfeature. In the case of polygons, the first coordinate pair (point) on the first line segment is the same \\nas the last coordinate pair on the last line segment. Polygons are used to represent features such as \\ncity boundaries, geologic formations, lakes, soil associations, vegetation communities, and so forth. \\nPolygons have the properties of area and perimeter. Polygons are also called areas. \\nVector Data Models Structures \\nVector data models can be structured many different ways. We will examine two of the more common \\ndata structures here. The simplest vector data structure is called the spaghetti data model (Dangermond \\n1982). [2] In the spaghetti model, each point, line, and/or polygon feature is represented as a string of X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs (or as a single X, Y coordinate pair in the case of a vector image with a single point) with \\nno inherent structure (Figure 4.9 \"Spaghetti Data Model\"). One could envision each line in this model to \\nbe a single strand of spaghetti that is formed into complex shapes by the addition of more and more \\nstrands of spaghetti. It is notable that in this model, any polygons that lie adjacent to each other must be \\nmade up of their own lines, or stands of spaghetti. In other words, each polygon must be uniquely defined \\nby its own set of X, Y coordinate pairs, even if the adjacent polygons share the exact same boundary \\ninformation. This creates some redundancies within the data model and therefore reduces efficiency. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  88 \\nFigure 4.9 Spaghetti Data Model \\n \\nDespite the location designations associated with each line, or strand of spaghetti, spatial relationships \\nare not explicitly encoded within the spaghetti model; rather, they are  implied by their location. This \\nresults in a lack of topological information, which is problematic if the user attempts to make \\nmeasurements or analysis. The computational requirements, therefore, are very steep if any advanced \\nanalytical techniques are employed on vector files structured thusly. Nevertheless, the simple structure of \\nthe spaghetti data model allows for efficient reproduction of maps and graphics as this topological \\ninformation is unnecessary for plotting and printing. \\nIn contrast to the spaghetti data model, the topological data model is characterized by the inclusion of \\ntopological information within the dataset, as the name implies. Topology is a set of rules that model the \\nrelationships between neighboring points, lines, and polygons and determines how they share geometry. \\nFor example, consider two adjacent polygons. In the spaghetti model, the shared boundary of two \\nneighboring polygons is defined as two separate, identical lines. The inclusion of topology into the data \\nmodel allows for a single line to represent this shared boundary with an explicit reference to denote which \\nside of the line belongs with which polygon. Topology is also concerned with preserving spatial properties \\nwhen the forms are bent, stretched, or placed under similar geometric transformations, which allows for \\nmore efficient projection and reprojection of map files. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  89 \\nThree basic topological precepts that are necessary to understand the topological data model are outlined \\nhere. First, connectivity describes the arc-node topology for the feature dataset. As discussed previously, \\nnodes are more than simple points. In the topological data model, nodes are the intersection points where \\ntwo or more arcs meet. In the case of arc-node topology, arcs have both a from-node (i.e., starting node) \\nindicating where the arc begins and a to-node (i.e., ending node) indicating where the arc ends (Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\"). In addition, between each node pair is a line segment, sometimes called a \\nlink, which has its own identification number and references both its from-node and to-node. In Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\", arcs 1, 2, and 3 all intersect because they share node 11. Therefore, the \\ncomputer can determine that it is possible to move along arc 1 and turn onto arc 3, whi le it is not possible \\nto move from arc 1 to arc 5, as they do not share a common node. \\nFigure 4.10 Arc-Node Topology \\n \\nThe second basic topological precept is area definition. Area definition states that an arc that connects to \\nsurround an area defines a polygon, also called polygon-arc topology. In the case of polygon-arc topology, \\narcs are used to construct polygons, and each arc is stored only once (Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc \\nTopology\"). This results in a reduction in the amount of data stored and ensures  that adjacent polygon \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  90 \\nboundaries do not overlap. In the Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc Topology\", the polygon-arc topology makes it \\nclear that polygon F is made up of arcs 8, 9, and 10. \\nFigure 4.11 Polygon-Arc Topology \\n \\nContiguity, the third topological precept, is based on the concept that polygons that share a boundary are \\ndeemed adjacent. Specifically, polygon topology requires that all arcs in a polygon have a direction (a \\nfrom-node and a to-node), which allows adjacency information to be determined (Figure 4.12 \"Polygon \\nTopology\"). Polygons that share an arc are deemed adjacent, or contiguous, and therefore the \u201cleft\u201d and \\n\u201cright\u201d side of each arc can be defined. This left and right polygon information is stored explicitly within \\nthe attribute information of the topological data model. The \u201cuniverse polygon\u201d is an essential component \\nof polygon topology that represents the external area located outside of the study area.  Figure 4.12 \\n\"Polygon Topology\" shows that arc 6 is bound on the left by polygon B and to the right by polygon C. \\nPolygon A, the universe polygon, is to the left of arcs 1, 2, and 3.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  91 \\nFigure 4.12 Polygon Topology \\n \\nTopology allows the computer to rapidly determine and analyze the spatial relationships of all its included \\nfeatures. In addition, topological information is important because it allows for efficient error detection \\nwithin a vector dataset. In the case of polygon features, open or unclosed polygons, which occur when an \\narc does not completely loop back upon itself, and unlabeled polygons, which occur when an area does not \\ncontain any attribute information, violate polygon-arc topology rules. Another topological error found \\nwith polygon features is the sliver. Slivers occur when the shared boundary of two polygons do not meet \\nexactly (Figure 4.13 \"Common Topological Errors\"). \\nIn the case of line features, topological errors occur when two lines do not meet perfectly at a node. This \\nerror is called an \u201cundershoot\u201d when the lines do not extend far enough to meet each other and an \\n\u201covershoot\u201d when the line extends beyond the feature it should connect to (Figure 4.13 \"Common \\nTopological Errors\"). The result of overshoots and undershoots is a \u201cdangling node\u201d at the end of the line. \\nDangling nodes aren\u2019t always an error, however, as they occur in the case of dead-end streets on a road \\nmap. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  92 \\nFigure 4.13 Common Topological Errors \\n \\nMany types of spatial analysis require the degree of organization offered by topologically explicit data \\nmodels. In particular, network analysis (e.g., finding the best route from one location to another) and \\nmeasurement (e.g., finding the length of a river segment) relies heavily on the concept of to - and from-\\nnodes and uses this information, along with attribute information, to calculate distances, shortest rou tes, \\nquickest routes, and so forth. Topology also allows for sophisticated neighborhood analysis such as \\ndetermining adjacency, clustering, nearest neighbors, and so forth. \\nNow that the basics of the concepts of topology have been outlined, we can begin to  better understand the \\ntopological data model. In this model, the node acts as more than just a simple point along a line or \\npolygon. The node represents the point of intersection for two or more arcs. Arcs may or may not be \\nlooped into polygons. Regardless, all nodes, arcs, and polygons are individually numbered. This \\nnumbering allows for quick and easy reference within the data model.  \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Vector Model \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  93 \\nIn comparison with the raster data model, vector data models tend to be better representations of reality \\ndue to the accuracy and precision of points, lines, and polygons over the regularly spaced grid cells of the \\nraster model. This results in vector data tending to be more aesthetically pleasing than raster data. \\nVector data also provides an increased ability to alter the scale of observation and analysis. As each \\ncoordinate pair associated with a point, line, and polygon represents an infinitesimally exact location \\n(albeit limited by the number of significant digits and/or data acquisition methodologies), zooming deep \\ninto a vector image does not change the view of a vector graphic in the way that it does a raster graphic \\n(see Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nVector data tend to be more compact in data structure, so file sizes are typically much smaller than their \\nraster counterparts. Although the ability of modern computers has minimized the importance of \\nmaintaining small file sizes, vector data often require a fraction the computer storage space when \\ncompared to raster data. \\nThe final advantage of vector data is that topology is inherent in the vector model. This topological \\ninformation results in simplified spatial analysis (e.g., error detection, network analysis, proximity \\nanalysis, and spatial transformation) when using a vector model. \\nAlternatively, there are two primary disadvantages of the vector data model. First, the data structure \\ntends to be much more complex than the simple raster data model. As the location of each vertex must be \\nstored explicitly in the model, there are no shortcuts for storing data like there are for raster models (e.g., \\nthe run-length and quad-tree encoding methodologies). \\nSecond, the implementation of spatial analysis can also be relatively complicated due to minor differences \\nin accuracy and precision between the input datasets. Similarly, the algorithms for manipulating and \\nanalyzing vector data are complex and can lead to intensive processing  requirements, particularly when \\ndealing with large datasets. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector data utilizes points, lines, and polygons to represent the spatial features in a map.

The objective of this section is to understand how satellite imagery and aerial photography are \\nimplemented in GIS applications. \\nA wide variety of satellite imagery and aerial photography is available for use in geographic \\ninformation systems (GISs). Although these products are basically raster graphics, they are \\nsubstantively different in their usage within a GIS. Satellite imagery and aerial photography provide \\nimportant contextual information for a GIS and are often used to conduct heads-up digitizing \\n(Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1.4 \"Secondary Data Capture\") whereby \\nfeatures from the image are converted into vector datasets. \\nSatellite Imagery \\nRemotely sensed satellite imagery is becoming increasingly common as satellites equipped with \\ntechnologically advanced sensors are continually being sent into space by pu blic agencies and private \\ncompanies around the globe. Satellites are used for applications such as military and civilian earth \\nobservation, communication, navigation, weather, research, and more. Currently, more than 3,000 \\nsatellites have been sent to space, with over 2,500 of them originating from Russia and the United States. \\nThese satellites maintain different altitudes, inclinations, eccentricities, synchronies, and orbital centers, \\nallowing them to image a wide variety of surface features and processes  (Figure 4.14 \"Satellites Orbiting \\nthe Earth\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  96 \\nFigure 4.14 Satellites Orbiting the Earth \\n \\nSatellites can be active or passive. Active satellites make use of remote sensors that detect reflected \\nresponses from objects that are irradiated from artificially generated energy sources. For example, active \\nsensors such as radars emit radio waves, laser sensors emit light waves, and sonar sensors emit sound \\nwaves. In all cases, the sensor emits the signal and then calculates the time it takes for the returned signal \\nto \u201cbounce\u201d back from some remote feature. Knowing the speed of the emitted signal, the time delay from \\nthe original emission to the return can be used to calculate the distance to the feature.  \\nPassive satellites, alternatively, make use of sensors that detect the reflected or emitted electromagnetic \\nradiation from natural sources. This natural source is typically the energy from the sun, but other sources \\ncan be imaged as well, such as magnetism and geothermal activity. Using an example we\u2019ve all \\nexperienced, taking a picture with a flash-enabled camera would be active remote sensing, while using a \\ncamera without a flash (i.e., relying on ambient light to illuminate the scene) would be passive remote \\nsensing. \\nThe quality and quantity of satellite imagery is largely determined by their resolution. There are four types \\nof resolution that characterize any particular remote sensor (Campbell 2002).  [1] The spatial resolution of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  97 \\na satellite image, as described previously in the raster data model se ction (Section 4.1 \"Raster Data \\nModels\"), is a direct representation of the ground coverage for each pixel shown in the image. If a satellite \\nproduces imagery with a 10 m resolution, the corresponding ground coverage for each of those pixels is 10 \\nm by 10 m, or 100 square meters on the ground. Spatial resolution is determined by the sensors\u2019 \\ninstantaneous field of view (IFOV). The IFOV is essentially the ground area through which the sensor is \\nreceiving the electromagnetic radiation signal and is determined by height and angle of the imaging \\nplatform. \\nSpectral resolution denotes the ability of the sensor to resolve wavelength intervals, also called bands, \\nwithin the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral resolution is determined by the interval size of the \\nwavelengths and the number of intervals being scanned. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are \\nthose sensors that can resolve a multitude of wavelengths intervals within the spectrum. For example, the \\nIKONOS satellite resolves images for bands at the blue (445\u2013516 nm), green (506\u201395 nm), red (632\u201398 \\nnm), and near-infrared (757\u2013853 nm) wavelength intervals on its 4-meter multispectral sensor. \\nTemporal resolution is the amount of time between each image collection period and is determined by the \\nrepeat cycle of the satellite\u2019s orbit. Temporal resolution can be thought of as true-nadir or off-nadir. Areas \\nconsidered true-nadir are those located directly beneath the sensor while off-nadir areas are those that are \\nimaged obliquely. In the case of the IKONOS satellite, the temporal resolution is 3 to 5 days for off-nadir \\nimaging and 144 days for true-nadir imaging. \\nThe fourth and final type of resolution, radiometric resolution, refers to the sensitivity of the sensor to \\nvariations in brightness and specifically denotes the number of grayscale levels that can be imaged by the \\nsensor. Typically, the available radiometric values for a sensor are 8-bit (yielding values that range from \\n0\u2013255 as 256 unique values or as 28 values); 11-bit (0\u20132,047); 12-bit (0\u20134,095); or 16-bit (0\u201363,535) \\n(see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\",Section 5.1.1 \"Data Types\" for more on bits). Landsat-7, for \\nexample, maintains 8-bit resolution for its bands and can therefore record values for each pixel that range \\nfrom 0 to 255. \\nBecause of the technical constraints associated with satellite remote sensing systems, there is a trade -off \\nbetween these different types of resolution. Improving one type of resolution often necessitates a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  98 \\nreduction in one of the other types of resolution. For example, an increase in spatial resolution is typically \\nassociated with a decrease in spectral resolution, and vice versa. Similarly,  geostationary satellites (those \\nthat circle the earth proximal to the equator once each day) yield high temporal resolution but low spatial \\nresolution, while sun-synchronous satellites (those that synchronize a near-polar orbit of the sensor with \\nthe sun\u2019s illumination) yield low temporal resolution while providing high spatial resolution. Although \\ntechnological advances can generally improve the various resolutions of an image, care must always be \\ntaken to ensure that the imagery you have chosen is adequate to the represent or model the geospatial \\nfeatures that are most important to your study. \\nAerial Photography \\nAerial photography, like satellite imagery, represents a vast source of information for use in any GIS. \\nPlatforms for the hardware used to take aerial photographs include airplanes, helicopters, balloons, \\nrockets, and so forth. While aerial photography connotes images taken of the visible spectrum, sensors to \\nmeasure bands within the nonvisible spectrum (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared, near -infrared) can also be fixed \\nto aerial sources. Similarly, aerial photography can be active or passive and can be taken from vert ical or \\noblique angles. Care must be taken with aerial photographs as the sensors used to take the images are \\nsimilar to cameras in their use of lenses. These lenses add a curvature to the images, which becomes more \\npronounced as one moves away from the center of the photo (Figure 4.15 \"Curvature Error Due to \\nLenticular Properties of Camera\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  99 \\nFigure 4.15 Curvature Error Due to Lenticular Properties of Camera \\n \\nAnother source of potential error in an aerial photograph is relief displacement. This error arises from the \\nthree-dimensional aspect of terrain features and is seen as apparent leaning away of vertical objects from \\nthe center point of an aerial photograph. To imagine this type of error, consider that a smokestack would \\nlook like a doughnut if the viewing camera was directly above the feature. However, if this same \\nsmokestack was observed near the edge of the camera\u2019s view, one could observe the sides of the \\nsmokestack. This error is frequently seen with trees and multistory buildings and worsens w ith \\nincreasingly taller features. \\nOrthophotos are vertical photographs that have been geometrically \u201ccorrected\u201d to remove the curvature \\nand terrain-induced error from images (Figure 4.16 \"Orthophoto\"). The most common orthophoto \\nproduct is the digital ortho quarter quadrangle (DOQQ). DOQQs are available through the US Geological \\nSurvey (USGS), who began producing these images from their library of 1:40,000- scale National Aerial \\nPhotography Program photos. These images can be obtained in either grayscale or color with 1-meter \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  100 \\nspatial resolution and 8-bit radiometric resolution. As the name suggests, these images cover a quarter of \\na USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, which equals an approximately 25 square mile area. Included with these \\nphotos is an additional 50 to 300-meter edge around the photo that allows users to mosaic many DOQQs \\ninto a single, continuous image. These DOQQs are ideal for use in a GIS as background display \\ninformation, for data editing, and for heads-up digitizing. \\nFigure 4.16 Orthophoto \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  101 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery is a common tool for GIS mapping applications as this data becomes increasingly \\navailable due to ongoing technological advances. \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery can be passive or active. \\n\u2022 The four types of resolution associated with satellite imagery are spatial, spectral, temporal, and \\nradiometric. \\n\u2022 Vertical and oblique aerial photographs provide valuable baseline informati on for GIS applications. \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The variety of formats and data structures, as well as the disparate quality, \\nof geospatial data can result in a dizzying accumulation of useful and useless pieces of spatially \\nexplicit information that must be poked, prodded, and wrangled into a single, unified dataset. This \\nchapter addresses the basic concerns related to data acquisition and management of the various \\nformats and qualities of geospatial data currently available for use in modern geographic information \\nsystem (GIS) projects. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  103 \\n5.1 Geographic Data Acquisition \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to introduce different data types, measurement scales, and data capture \\nmethods. \\nAcquiring geographic data is an important factor in any geographic information system (GIS) effort. \\nIt has been estimated that data acquisition typically consumes 60 to 80 percent of the time and \\nmoney spent on any given project. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that GIS projects remain \\nmindful of their stated goals so the collection of spatial data proceeds in an efficient and effective \\nmanner as possible. This chapter outlines the many forms and sources of geospatial data available \\nfor use in a GIS. \\nData Types \\nThe type of data that we employ to help us understand a given entity is determined by (1) what we are \\nexamining, (2) what we want to know about that entity, and (3) our ability to measure that entity at a \\ndesired scale. The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, \\nnumbers, Boolean values, dates, and binaries. \\nAn alphanumeric string, or text, data type is any simple combination of letters and numbers that may or \\nmay not form coherent words. The number data type can be subcategorized as either floating-point or \\ninteger. A floating-point is any data value that contains decimal digits, while an integer is any data value \\nthat does not contain decimal digits. Integers can be short or long depending on the amount of significant \\ndigits in that number. Also, they are based on the concept of the \u201cbit\u201d in a computer. As you may recall, a \\nbit is the most basic unit of information in a computer and stores values in one of two states: 1 or 0. \\nTherefore, an 8-bit attribute would consist of eight 1s or 0s in any combination (e.g., 10010011, 00011011, \\n11100111). \\nShort integers are 16-bit values and therefore can be used to characterize numbers ranging either from \\n\u221232,768 to 32,767 or from 0 to 65,535 depending on whether the number is signed or unsigned (i.e., Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  104 \\ncontains a + or \u2212 sign).Long integers, alternatively, are 32-bit values and therefore can characterize \\nnumbers ranging either from \u22122,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or from 0 to 4,294,967,295.  \\nA single precision floating-point value occupies 32 bits, like the long integer. However, this data type \\nprovides for a value of up to 7 bits to the left of the decimal (a maxi mum value of 128, or 127 if signed) and \\nup to 23-bit values to the right of the decimal point (approximately 7 decimal digits). A \\ndouble precision floating-point value essentially stores two 32-bit values as a single value. Double \\nprecision floats, then, can represent a value with up to 11 bits to the left of the decimal point and values \\nwith up to 52 bits to the right of the decimal (approximately 16 decimal digits) ( Figure 5.1 \"Double \\nPrecision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer\"). \\nFigure 5.1 Double Precision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer \\n \\nBoolean, date, and binary values are less complex. Boolean values are simply those values that are deemed \\ntrue or false based on the application of a Boolean operator such  as AND, OR, and NOT. The date data \\ntype is presumably self-explanatory, while the binary data type represents attributes whose values are \\neither 1 or 0. \\nMeasurement Scale \\nIn addition to defining data by type, a measurement scale acts to group data accordi ng to level of \\ncomplexity (Stevens 1946). [1] For the purposes of GIS analyses, measurement scales can be grouped in to \\ntwo general categories. Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data; interval and ratio data \\nrepresent numeric data. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  105 \\nThe most simple data measurement scale is the nominal, or named, scale. The nominal scale makes \\nstatements about what to call data points but does not allow for scalar comparisons between one object \\nand another. For example, the attribution of nominal information to a set of points that represent cities \\nwill describe whether the given locale is \u201cLos Angeles\u201d or \u201cNew York.\u201d However, no further denotations, \\nsuch as population or voting history, can be made about those locales. Other examples of nominal data \\ninclude last name, eye color, land-use type, ethnicity, and gender. \\nOrdinal data places attribute information into ranks and therefore yields more precisely scaled \\ninformation than nominal data. Ordinal data describes the position in which data occur, such as first,  \\nsecond, third, and so forth. These scales may also take on names, such as \u201cvery unsatisfied,\u201d \u201cunsatisfied,\u201d \\n\u201csatisfied,\u201d and \u201cvery satisfied.\u201d Although this measurement scale indicates the ranking of each data point \\nrelative to other data points, the ordinal scale does not explicitly denote the exact quantitative difference \\nbetween these rankings. For example, if an ordinal attribute represents which runner came in first, \\nsecond, or third place, it does not state by how much time the winning runner beat the second place \\nrunner. Therefore, one cannot undertake arithmetic operations with ordinal data. Only sequence is \\nexplicit. \\nA measurement scale that does allow precise quantitative statements to be made about attributes \\nis interval data. Interval data are measured along a scale in which each position is equidistant to one \\nanother. Elevation and temperature readings are common representations of interval data. For example, \\nit can be determined through this scale that 30 \u00baF is 5 \u00baF warmer than 25 \u00baF. A notabl e property of the \\ninterval scale is that zero is not a meaningful value in the sense that zero does not represent nothingness, \\nor the absence of a value. Indeed, 0 \u00baF does not indicate that no temperature exists. Similarly, an \\nelevation of 0 feet does not indicate a lack of elevation; rather, it indicates mean sea level.  \\nRatio data are similar to the interval measurement scale; however, it is based around a meaningful zero \\nvalue. Population density is an example of ratio data whereby a 0 population density indicates that no \\npeople live in the area of interest. Similarly, the Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale as 0 K does imply \\nthat no heat (temperature) is measurable within the given attribute.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  106 \\nSpecific to numeric datasets, data values also can be considered to be discrete or \\ncontinuous. Discrete data are those that maintain a finite number of possible values, \\nwhile continuous data can be represented by an infinite number of values. For example, the number of \\nmature trees on a small property will necessarily be between one and one hundred (for argument\u2019s sake). \\nHowever, the height of those trees represents a continuous data value as there are an infinite number of \\npotential values (e.g., one tree may be 20 feet tall, 20.1 feet, or 20.15 feet, 20.157 fee t, and so forth). \\nPrimary Data Capture \\nNow that we have a sense of the different data types and measurement scales available for use in a GIS, we \\nmust direct our thoughts to how this data can be acquired. Primary data capture is a direct data \\nacquisition methodology that is usually associated with some type of in -the-field effort. In the case of \\nvector data, directly captured data commonly comes from a global positioning system (GPS) or other \\ntypes of surveying equipment such as a total station (Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station \\n(right)\"). Total stations are specialized, primary data capture instruments that combine a theodolite (or \\ntransit), which measures horizontal and vertical angles, with a tool to measure the slope distance from the \\nunit to an observed point. Use of a total station allows field crews to quickly and accurately derive the \\ntopography for a particular landscape. \\nFigure 5.2 GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right) \\n \\nIn the case of GPS, handheld units access positional data from satellites and log the information for \\nsubsequent retrieval. A network of twenty-four navigation satellites is situated around the globe and \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  107 \\nprovides precise coordinate information for any point on the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 5.3 \"Earth Imaging \\nSatellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Maintaining a line of sight to four or more of these satellites provides \\nthe user with reasonably accurate location information. These locations can be collected as individual \\npoints or can be linked together to form lines or polygons depending on user preference. Attribute data \\nsuch as land-use type, telephone pole number, and river name can be simultaneously entered by the user. \\nThis location and attribute data can then be uploaded to the GIS for visualization. Depending on the G PS \\nmake and model, this upload often requires some type of intermediate file conversion via software \\nprovided by the manufacturer of the GPS unit. However, there are some free online resources that can \\nconvert GPS data from one format to another. GPSBabel is an example of such an online resource \\n(http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/gpsbabel). \\nIn addition to the typical GPS unit shown in Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right)\", GPS is \\nbecoming increasingly incorporated into other new technologies. For example, smartphones now embed \\nGPS capabilities as a standard technological component. These phone/GPS units maintain comparable \\naccuracy to similarly priced stand-alone GPS units and are largely responsible for a renaissance in \\nfacilitating portable, real-time data capture and sharing to the masses. The ubiquity of this technology led \\nto a proliferation of crowdsourced data acquisition alternatives. Crowdsourcing is a data collection \\nmethod whereby users contribute freely to building spatial databases. This rapidly expanding \\nmethodology is utilized in such applications as TomTom\u2019s MapShare application, Google Earth, Bing \\nMaps, and ArcGIS. \\nRaster data obtained via direct capture comes more commonly from remotely sensed sources ( Figure 5.3 \\n\"Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Remotely sensed data offers the advantage of \\nobviating the need for physical access to the area being imaged. In addition, huge tracts of land can be \\ncharacterized with little to no additional time and labor by the researcher. On the other hand, validation is \\nrequired for remotely sensed data to ensure that the sensor is not only operating correctly but properly \\ncalibrated to collect the desired information. Satellites and aerial cameras provide the most ubiquitous \\nsources of direct-capture raster data (Chapter 4 \"Data Models for GIS\", Section 4.3.1 \"Satellite Imagery\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  108 \\nFigure 5.3 Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data \\n \\nSecondary Data Capture \\nSecondary data capture is an indirect methodology that utilizes the vast amount of existing geospatial data \\navailable in both digital and hard-copy formats. Prior to initiating any GIS effort, it is always wise to mine \\nonline resources for existing GIS data that may fulfill your mapping needs without the potentially \\nintensive step of creating the data from scratch. Such digital GIS data are available from a variety of \\nsources including international agencies (CGIAR, CIESIN, United Nations, World Bank, etc.) ; federal \\ngovernments (USGS, USDA, NOAA, USFWS, NASA, EPA, US Census, etc.); state governments (CDFG, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  109 \\nTeale Data Center, INGIS, MARIS, NH GIS Resources, etc.); local governments (SANDAG, RCLIS, etc.); \\nuniversity websites (UCLA, Duke, Stanford, University of Chicago, Indiana Spatial Data Portal, etc.); and \\ncommercial websites (ESRI, GeoEye, Geocomm, etc.). These secondary data are available in a wide \\nassortment of file types, extents, and sizes but is ready-made to be used in most GIS software packages. \\nOften these data are free, but many sites will charge a fee for access to the proprietary information they \\nhave developed. \\nAlthough these data sources are all cases where the information has been converted to digital format and \\nproperly projected for use in a GIS, there is also a great deal of spatial information that can be gleaned \\nfrom existing, nondigital sources. Paper maps, for example, may contain current or historic information \\non a locale that cannot be found in digital format. In this case, the process  of digitization can be used to \\ncreate digital files from the original paper copy. Three primary methods exist for digitizing spatial \\ninformation: two are manual, and one is automated. \\nTablet digitizing is a manual data capture method whereby a user enters coordinate information into a \\ncomputer through the use of a digitizing tablet and a digitizing puck. To begin, a paper map is secured to a \\nback-lit digitizing tablet. The backlight allows all features on the map to be easily observed, which reduces \\neyestrain. The coordinates of the point, line, and/or polygon features on the paper map are then entered \\ninto a digital file as the user employs a puck, which is similar to a multibutton mouse with a crosshair, to \\n\u201cclick\u201d their way around the vertices of each desired feature. The resulting digital file will need to be \\nproperly georeferenced following completion of the digitization task to ensure that this information will \\nproperly align with existing datasets. \\nHeads-up digitizing, the second manual data capture method, is referred to as \u201con-screen\u201d digitizing. \\nHeads-up digitizing can be used on either paper maps or existing digital files. In the case of a paper map, \\nthe map must first be scanned into the computer at a high enough resolution that will allow all per tinent \\nfeatures to be resolved. Second, the now-digital image must be registered so the map will conform to an \\nexisting coordinate system. To do this, the user can enter control points on the screen and transform, or \\n\u201crubber-sheet,\u201d the scanned image into real world coordinates. Finally, the user simply zooms to specific \\nareas on the map and traces the points, lines, and/or polygons, similar to the tablet digitization example. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  110 \\nHeads-up digitizing is particularly simple when existing GIS files, satellite ima ges, or aerial photographs \\nare used as a baseline. For example, if a user plans to digitize the boundary of a lake as seen from a \\ngeoreferenced satellite image, the steps of scanning and registering can be skipped, and projection \\ninformation from the originating image can simply be copied over to the digitized file. \\nThe third, automated method of secondary data capture requires the user to scan a paper map and \\nvectorize the information therein. This vectorization method typically requires a specific software package \\nthat can convert a raster scan to vector lines. This requires a very high-resolution, clean scan. If the image \\nis not clean, all the imperfections on the map will likely be converted to false points/lines/polygons in the \\ndigital version. If a clean scan is not available, it is often faster to use a manual digitization methodology. \\nRegardless, this method is much quicker than the aforementioned manual methods and may be the best \\noption if multiple maps must be digitized and/or if time is a limiting factor. Often, a semiautomatic \\napproach is employed whereby a map is scanned and vectorized, followed by a heads- up digitizing session \\nto edit and repair any errors that occurred during automation. \\nThe final secondary data capture method worth noting is the use of information from  reports and \\ndocuments. Via this method, one enters information from reports and documents into the attribute \\ntable of an existing, digital GIS file that contains all the pertinent points, lines, and polygons. For example, \\nnew information specific to census tracts may become available following a scientific study. The GIS user \\nsimply needs to download the existing GIS file of census tracts and begin entering the study\u2019s \\nreport/document information directly into the attribute table. If the data tables are available digitally, the \\nuse of the \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201crelate\u201d functions in a GIS (Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\") are often extremely \\nhelpful as they will automate much of the data entry effort. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, numbers, Boolean \\nvalues, dates, and binaries. \\n\u2022 Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data, while interval and ratio data represent numeric \\ndata. \\n\u2022 Data capture methodologies are derived from either primary or secondary sources. \\n Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  111 \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand the basic properties of a relational database management \\nsystem. \\nA database is a structured collection of data files. A database management system (DBMS) is a software \\npackage that allows for the creation, storage, maintenance, manipulation, and retrieval of large \\ndatasets that are distributed over one or more files. A DBMS and its associated functions are usually \\naccessed through commercial software packages such as Microsoft Access, Oracle, FileMaker Pro, or \\nAvanquest MyDataBase. Database management normally refers to the management of tabular data \\nin row and column format and is frequently used for personal, business, government, and scientific \\nendeavors. Geospatial database management systems, alternatively, include the functionality of a \\nDBMS but also contain specific geographic information about each data point such as identity, \\nlocation, shape, and orientation. Integrating this geographic information with the tabular attribute \\ndata of a classical DBMS provide users with powerful tools to visualize and answer the spatially \\nexplicit questions that arise in an increasingly technological society. \\nSeveral types of database models exist, such as the flat, hierarchical, network, and relational models \\n(Worboys 1995; Jackson 1999). [1], [2] A flat database is essentially a spreadsheet whereby all data are \\nstored in a single, large table (Figure 5.4 \"Flat Database\"). A hierarchical database is also a fairly \\nsimple model that organizes data into a \u201cone-to-many\u201d association across levels (Figure 5.5 \\n\"Hierarchical Database\"). Common examples of this model include phylogenetic trees for \\nclassification of plants and animals and familial genealogical trees showing parent-child \\nrelationships. Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases, however, because they also \\nsupport \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationships (Figure 5.6 \"Network Database\"). This expanded capability \\nallows greater search flexibility within the dataset and reduces potential redundancy of information. \\nAlternatively, both the hierarchical and network models can become incredibly complex depending \\non the size of the databases and the number of interactions between the data points. Modern Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  113 \\ngeographic information system (GIS) software typically employs a fourth model referred to as \\na relational database (Codd 1970). [3] \\nFigure 5.4 Flat Database \\n \\nFigure 5.5 Hierarchical Database \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  114 \\nFigure 5.6 Network Database \\n \\nRelational Database Management Systems \\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of tables that are connected in such a \\nway that that data can be accessed without reorganization of the tables. The tables are created such that \\neach column represents a particular attribute (e.g., soil type, PIN number, last name, acreage) and each \\nrow contains a unique instance of data for that columnar attribute (e.g., Delhi Sands Soils, 5555, Smith, \\n412.3 acres) \\nIn the relational model, each table (not surprisingly called a relation) is linked to each other table via \\npredetermined keys (Date 1995). [4] The primary key represents the attribute (column) whose value \\nuniquely identifies a particular record (row) in the relation (table). The primary key may not contain \\nmissing values as multiple missing values would represent nonunique entities that violate the basic rule of \\nthe primary key. The primary key corresponds to an identical attribute in a secondary table (and possibly \\nthird, fourth, fifth, etc.) called a foreign key. This results in all the information in the first table being \\ndirectly related to the information in the second table via the primary and foreign keys, hence the term \\n\u201crelational\u201d DBMS. With these links in place, tables within the database can be kept very simple, resulting \\nin minimal computation time and file complexity. This process can be repeated over many tables as long \\nas each contains a foreign key that corresponds to another table\u2019s primary key. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  115 \\nThe relational model has two primary advantages over the other database models described earlier. First, \\neach table can now be separately prepared, maintained, and edited. This is particularly useful when one \\nconsiders the potentially huge size of many of today\u2019s modern databases. Second, the tables may be \\nmaintained separately until the need for a particular query or analysis calls for the tables to be related. \\nThis creates a large degree of efficiency for processing of information within a given database.  \\nIt may become apparent to the reader that there is great potential for redundancy in this model as each \\ntable must contain an attribute that corresponds to an attribute in every other related table. Therefore, \\nredundancy must actively be monitored and managed in a RDBMS. To accomplish this, a set of rules \\ncalled normal forms have been developed (Codd 1970). [5] There are three basic normal forms. \\nThe first normal form (Figure 5.7 \"First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below)\") refers to five \\nconditions that must be met (Date 1995). [6] They are as follows: \\n1. There is no sequence to the ordering of the rows. \\n2. There is no sequence to the ordering of the columns. \\n3. Each row is unique. \\n4. Every cell contains one and only one value. \\n5. All values in a column pertain to the same subject. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  116 \\nFigure 5.7 First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe second normal form states that any column that is not a primary key must be dependent on the \\nprimary key. This reduces redundancy by eliminating the potential for mult iple primary keys throughout \\nmultiple tables. This step often involves the creation of new tables to maintain normalization.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  117 \\nFigure 5.8 Second Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe third normal form states that all nonprimary keys must depend on the primary key, while the primary \\nkey remains independent of all nonprimary keys. This form was wittily summed up by Kent (1983)  [7] who \\nquipped that all nonprimary keys \u201cmust provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the \\nkey.\u201d Echoing this quote is the rejoinder: \u201cso help me Codd\u201d (personal communication with Foresman \\n1989). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  118 \\nFigure 5.9 Third Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nJoins and Relates \\nAn additional advantage of an RDBMS is that it allows attribute data in separate tables to be linked in a \\npost hoc fashion. The two operations commonly used to accomplish this are the join and relate. \\nThe join operation appends the fields of one table into a second table through the use of an attribute or \\nfield that is common to both tables. This is commonly utilized to combine attribute information from one \\nor more nonspatial data tables (i.e., information taken from reports or documents) with a spatially explicit \\nGIS feature layer. A second type of join combines feature information based on spatial location and \\nassociation rather than on common attributes. In ArcGIS, three types of spatial joins are available. Users \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  119 \\nmay (1) match each feature to the closest feature, (2) match each feature to the feature that it is part of, or \\n(3) match each feature to the feature that it intersects. \\nAlternatively, the relate operation temporarily associates two map layers or tables while keeping them \\nphysically separate. Relates are bidirectional, so data can be accessed from the one of the tables by \\nselecting records in the other table. The relate operation also allows for the association of three or more \\ntables, if necessary. \\nSometimes it can be unclear as to which operation one should use. As a general rule, joins are most \\nsuitable for instances involving one-to-one or many-to-one relationships. Joins are also advantageous due \\nto the fact that the data from the two tables are readily observable in the single output table . The use of \\nrelates, on the other hand, are suitable for all table relationships (one -to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, \\nand many-to-many); however, they can slow down computer access time if the tables are particularly \\nlarge or spread out over remote locations. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Database management systems can be flat, hierarchical, network, or relational.  \\n\u2022 Relational database management systems (RDBMS) utilize primary keys and foreign keys to link data \\ntables. \\n\u2022 The RDBMS model reduces data redundancy by employing three basic \u201cnormal forms.\u201d  \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to overview a sample of the most common types of vector, raster, and \\nhybrid file formats. \\nGeospatial data are stored in many different file formats. Each geographic information system (GIS) \\nsoftware package, and each version of these software packages, supports different formats. This is \\ntrue for both vector and raster data. Although several of the more common file formats are \\nsummarized here, many other formats exist for use in various GIS programs. \\nVector File Formats \\nThe most common vector file format is the shapefile. Shapefiles, developed by ESRI in the early 1990s for \\nuse with the dBASE III database management software package in ArcView 2, are simple, nontopological \\nfiles developed to store the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. \\nShapefiles are incapable of storing null values, as well as annotations or network features. Field names \\nwithin the attribute table are limited to ten characters, and each shapefile can represent only point, line, \\nor polygon feature sets. Supported data types are limited to floating point, integer, date, and text. \\nShapefiles are supported by almost all commercial and open-source GIS software. \\nDespite being called a \u201cshapefile,\u201d this format is actually a compilation of many different files. Table 5.1 \\n\"Shapefile File Types\" lists and describes the different file formats associated with the shapefile. Among \\nthose listed, only the SHP, SHX, and DBF file formats are mandatory to create a functioning shapefile, \\nwhile all others are conditionally required. As a general rule, the names for each file should conform to the \\nMS-DOS 8.3 convention when using older versions of GIS software packages. According to this \\nconvention, the filename prefix can contain up to eight characters, and the filename suffix contains three \\ncharacters. The more recent GIS software packages have relaxed this requirement and will accept longer \\nfilename prefixes. \\nTable 5.1 Shapefile File Types Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  122 \\nFile Extension Purpose \\nSHP* Feature geometry \\nSHX* Index format for the feature geometry \\nDBF* Feature attribute information in dBASE IV format \\nPRJ Projection information \\nSBN and SBX Spatial index of the features \\nFBN and FBX Read-only spatial index of the features \\nAIN and AIH Attribute information for active fields in the table \\nIXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles \\nMXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles with ODB format \\nATX Attribute index used in ArcGIS 8 and later \\nSHP.XML Metadata in XML format \\nCPG Code page specifications for identifying character encoding \\n* Indicates mandatory files \\nThe earliest vector format file for use in GIS software packages, which is still in use today, is the \\nArcInfo coverage. This georelational file format supports multiple features types (e.g., points, lines, \\npolygons, annotations) while also storing the topological information associated with those features. \\nAttribute data are stored as multiple files in a separate directory labeled \u201cInfo.\u201d Due to its creation in an \\nMS-DOS environment, these files maintain strict naming conventions. File names cannot be longer than \\nthirteen characters, cannot contain spaces, cannot start with a number, and must be completely in \\nlowercase. Coverages cannot be edited in ArcGIS 9.x or later versions of ESRI\u2019s software package. \\nThe US Census Bureau maintains a specific type of shapefile referred to as TIGER \\norTIGER/Line (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system). Although these \\nopen-source files do not contain actual census information, they map features such as census tracts, \\nroads, railroads, buildings, rivers, and other features that support and improve the bureau and improve \\nthe Bureau\u2019s ability to#8217;s ability to collect census information. TIGER/Line shapefiles, first released \\nin 1990, are topologically explicit and are linked to the Census Bureau\u2019s Master Address File (MAF), Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  123 \\ntherefore enabling the geocoding of street addresses. These files are free to the public and can be freely \\ndownloaded from private vendors that support the format. \\nTheAutoCAD DXF (Drawing Interchange Format or Drawing Exchange Format)is a proprietary vector file \\nformat developed by Autodesk to allow interchange between engineering -based CAD (computer-aided \\ndesign) software and other mapping software packages. DXF files were originally released in 1982 with \\nthe purpose of providing an exact representation of AutoCAD\u2019s native DWG format. Although the DXF is \\nstill commonly used, newer versions of AutoCAD have incorporated more complex data types (e.g., \\nregions, dynamic blocks) that are not supported in the DXF format. Therefore, it may be presumed that \\nthe DXF format may become less popular in geospatial analysis over time.  \\nFinally, the US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains an open-source vector file format that details \\nphysical and cultural features across the United States. These topologically \\nexplicit DLGs (Digital Line Graphics) come in large-, intermediate-, and small-scale depending on \\nwhether they are derived from 1:24,000-; 1:100,000-; or 1:2,000,000-scale USGS topographic \\nquadrangle maps. The features available in the different DLG types depend on the scale of the DLG but \\ngenerally include data such as administrative and political boundaries, hydrography, transportation \\nsystems, hypsography, and land cover. \\nVector data files can also be structured to represent surface elevation information. \\nA TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) is an open-source vector data structure that uses contiguous, \\nnonoverlapping triangles to represent geographic surfaces (Figure 5.10 \"Triangulated Irregular Network \\n(TIN)\"). Whereas the raster depiction of a surface represents elevation as an average value over the spatial \\nextent of the individual pixel (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster File Formats\"), the TIN data structure models \\neach vertex of the triangle as an exact elevation value at a specific po int on the earth. The arcs between \\neach vertex are an approximation of the elevation between two vertices. These arcs are then aggregated \\ninto triangles from which information on elevation, slope, aspect, and surface area can be derived across \\nthe entire extent of the model\u2019s space. Note that term \u201cirregular\u201d in the name of the data model refers to \\nthe fact that the vertices are typically laid out in a scattered fashion.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  124 \\nFigure 5.10 Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) \\n \\nThe use of TINs confers certain advantages over raster-based elevation models (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster \\nFile Formats\"). First, linear topographic features are very accurately represented relative to their raster \\ncounterpart. Second, a comparatively small number of data points are needed  to represent a surface, so \\nfile sizes are typically much smaller. This is particularly true as vertices can be clustered in areas where \\nrelief is complex and can be sparse in areas where relief is simple. Third, specific elevation data can be \\nincorporated into the data model in a post hoc fashion via the placement of additional vertices if the \\noriginal is deemed insufficient or inadequate. Finally, certain spatial statistics can be calculated that \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  125 \\ncannot be obtained when using a raster-based elevation model, such as flood plain delineation, storage \\ncapacity curves for reservoirs, and time-area curves for hydrographs. \\nRaster File Formats \\nA multitude of raster file format types are available for use in GIS. The selection of raster formats has \\ndramatically increased with the widespread availability of imagery from digital cameras, video recorders, \\nsatellites, and so forth. Raster imagery is typically 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit (16 million colors). Due to \\nongoing technological advancements, raster image file sizes have been getting larger and larger. To deal \\nwith this potential constraint, two types of file compression are commonly used: lossless and \\nlossy. Lossless compression reduces file size without decreasing image quality.  Lossy compression \\nattempts to exploit limitations of the human eye by removing information from the image that cannot be \\nsensed. As you may guess, lossy compression results in smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  \\nAmong the most common raster files used on the web are the JPEG, T IFF, and PNG formats, all of which \\nare open source and can be used with most GIS software packages. \\nThe JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) andTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) raster formats are \\nmost frequently used by digital cameras to store 8-bit values for each of the red, blue, and green colors \\nspaces (and sometimes 16-bit colors, in the case of TIFF images). JPEGs support lossy compression, while \\nTIFFs can be either lossy or lossless. Unlike JPEG, TIFF images can be saved in either RGB or CMYK \\ncolor spaces.PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are 24-bit images that support either lossy or lossless \\ncompression. PNG files are designed for efficient viewing in web-based browsers such as Internet \\nExplorer, Mozilla Firefox, Netscape, and Safari. \\nNative JPEG, TIFF, and PNG files do not have georeferenced information associated with them and \\ntherefore cannot be used in any geospatial mapping efforts. In order to employ these files in a GIS, \\na world file must first be created. A world file is a separate, plaintext data file that specifies the locations \\nand transformations that allow the image to be projected into a standard coordinate system (e.g., \\nUniversal Transverse Mercator [UTM] or State Plane). The filename of the world file is based on the name \\nof the raster file, while a w is typically added into to the file extension. The world file extension name for a \\nJPEG is JPW; for a TIFF, it is TFW; and for a PNG, PGW. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  126 \\nAn example of a raster file format with explicit georeferencing information is the \\nproprietary MrSID (Multiresolution Seamless Image Database) format. This lossless compression format \\nwas developed by LizardTech, Inc., for use with large aerial photographs or satellite images, whereby \\nportions of a compressed image can be viewed quickly without having to decompress the entire file. The \\nMrSID format is frequently used for visualizing orthophotos. \\nLike MrSID, the proprietary ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) format also includes georeferencing \\ninformation within the file structure. This lossy compression format was developed by Earth Resource \\nMapping and supports up to 255 layers of image information. Due to the potentially huge file sizes \\nassociated with an image that supports so many layers, ECW files represent an excellent option for \\nperforming rapid analysis on large images while using a relatively small amount of the computer\u2019s RAM \\n(Random Access Memory), thus accelerating computation speed. \\nLike the open-source, vector-based DLG, DRGs (Digital Raster Graphics)are scanned versions of USGS \\ntopographic maps and include all of the collar material from the originals. The geospatial information \\nfound within the image\u2019s neatline is georeferenced, specifically to the UTM coordinate system. These \\ngraphics are scanned at a minimum of 250 dpi (dots per inch) and therefore have a spatial resolution of \\napproximately 2.4 meters. DRGs contain up to thirteen colors and therefore may look slightly different \\nfrom the originals. In addition, they include all the collar material from the original print vers ion, are \\ngeoreferenced to the surface of the earth, fit the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, and are \\nmost likely based on the NAD27 data points (NAD stands for North American Datum).  \\nLike the TIN vector format, some raster file formats are developed explicitly for modeling elevation. These \\ninclude the USGS DEM, USGS SDTS, and DTED file formats.  \\nTheUSGS DEM (US Geological Survey Digital Elevation Model) is a popular file format due to widespread \\navailability, the simplicity of the model, and the extensive software support for the format. Each pixel \\nvalue in these grid-based DEMs denotes spot elevations on the ground, usually in feet or meters. Care \\nmust be taken when using grid-based DEMs due to the enormous volume of data that accompanies the se \\nfiles as the spatial extent covered in the image begins to increase. DEMs are referred to \\nas digital terrain models (DTMs) when they represent a simple, bare-earth model and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  127 \\nas digital surface models (DSMs)when they include the heights of landscape features such as buildings \\nand trees (Figure 5.11 \"Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right)\" ). \\nFigure 5.11 Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right) \\n \\nUSGS DEMs can be classified into one of four levels of quality (labeled 1 to 4) depending on its source \\ndata and resolution. This source data can be 1:24,000-; 1:63,360-; or 1:250,000-scale topographic \\nquadrangles. The DEM format is a single file of ASCII text comprised of three data blocks; A, B, and C. \\nThe A block contains header information such as data origin, type, and measurement systems. The B \\nblock contains contiguous elevation data described as a six-character integer. The C block contains trailer \\ninformation such as root-mean square (RMS) error of the scene. The USGS DEM format has recently been \\nsucceeded by the USGS SDTS (Spatial Data Transfer Standard) DEMformat. The SDTS format [1] was \\nspecifically developed as a distribution format for transferring data from one computer to another with \\nzero data loss. \\nThe DTED (Digital Terrain Elevation Data) format is another elevation specific raster file format. It was \\ndeveloped in the 1970s for military purposes such as line of sight analysis, 3- D visualization, and mission \\nplanning. The DTED format maintains three levels of data over five different latitudinal zones. Level 0 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  128 \\ndata has a resolution of approximately 900 meters; Level 1 data has a resolution of approximately 90 \\nmeters; and Level 2 data has a resolution of approximately 30 meters.  \\nHybrid File Formats \\nA geodatabase is a recently developed, proprietary ESRI file format that supports both vector and raster \\nfeature datasets (e.g., points, lines, polygons, annotation, JPEG, TIFF) within a single file.  This format \\nmaintains topological relationships and is stored as an MDB file. The geodatabase was developed to be a \\ncomprehensive model for representing and modeling geospatial information.  \\nThere are three different types of geodatabases. The personal geodatabase was developed for single-user \\nediting, whereby two editors cannot work on the same geodatabase at a given time. The personal \\ngeodatabase employs the Microsoft Access DBMS file format and maintains a size limit of 2 gigabytes per \\nfile, although it has been noted that performance begins to degrade after file size approaches 250 \\nmegabytes. The personal geodatabase is currently being phased out by ESRI and is therefore not used for \\nnew data creation. \\nThe file geodatabase similarly allows only single-user editing, but this restriction applies only to unique \\nfeature datasets within a geodatabase. The file geodatabase incorporates new tools such as domains (rules \\napplied to attributes), subtypes (groups of objects with a feature class or table), and split/ merge policies \\n(rules to control and define the output of split and merge operations). This format stores information as \\nbinary files with a size limit of 1 terabyte and has been noted to perform and scale much more efficiently \\nthan the personal geodatabase (approximately one-third of the feature geometry storage required by \\nshapefiles and personal geodatabases). File databases are not tied to any specific relational database \\nmanagement system and can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. Finally,  file \\ngeodatabases can be compressed to read-only formats that further reduce file size without subsequently \\nreducing performance. \\nThe third hybrid ESRI format is the ArcSDE geodatabase, which allows multiple editors to simultaneously \\nwork on feature datasets within a single geodatabase (a.k.a. versioning). Like the file geodatabase, this \\nformat can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. File size is limited to 4 gigabytes and its Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  129 \\nproprietary nature requires an ArcInfo or ArcEditor license for use. The ArcSDE geodatabase is \\nimplemented on the SQL Server Express software package, which is a free DBMS platform developed by \\nMicrosoft. \\nIn addition to the geodatabase, Adobe Systems Incorporated\u2019s \\ngeospatial PDF (Portable Document Format) is an open-source format that allows for the representation \\nof geometric entities such as points, lines, and polygons. Geospatial PDFs can be used to find and mark \\ncoordinate pairs, measure distances, reproject files, and georegister raster images. This format is \\nparticularly useful as the PDF is widely accepted to be the preferred standard for printable web \\ndocuments. Although functionally similar, the geospatial PDF should not be confused with the GeoPDF \\nformat developed by TerraGo Technologies. Rather, the GeoPDF is a b randed version of the geospatial \\nPDF. \\nFinally, Google Earth supports a new, open-source, hybrid file format referred to as \\na KML (Keyhole Markup Language). KML files associate points, lines, polygons, images, 3-D models, and \\nso forth, with a longitude and latitude value, as well as other view information such as tilt, heading, \\naltitude, and so forth. KMZ files are commonly encountered, and they are zipped versions KML files.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Common vector file formats used in geospatial applications include shapefiles, coverages, TIGER/Lines, \\nAutoCAD DXFs, and DLGs. \\n\u2022 Common raster file formats used in geospatial applications include JPGs, TIFFs, PNGs, MrSIDs, ECWs, \\nDRGs, USGS DEMs, and DTEDs. \\n\u2022 Common hybrid file formats used in geospatial applications include geodatabases (personal, file, and \\nArcSDE) and geospatial PDFs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to ascertain the different types of error inherent in geospatial datasets.  \\nNot all geospatial data are created equally. Data quality refers to the ability of a given dataset to \\nsatisfy the objective for which it was created. With the voluminous amounts of geospatial data being \\ncreated and served to the cartographic community, care must be taken by individual geographic \\ninformation system (GIS) users to ensure that the data employed for their project is suitable for the \\ntask at hand. \\nTwo primary attributes characterize data quality. Accuracy describes how close a measurement is to \\nits actual value and is often expressed as a probability (e.g., 80 percent of all points are within +/\u2212 5 \\nmeters of their true locations). Precision refers to the variance of a value when repeated \\nmeasurements are taken. A watch may be correct to 1/1000th of a second (precise) but may be 30 \\nminutes slow (not accurate). As you can see in Figure 5.12 \"Accuracy and Precision\", the blue darts \\nare both precise and accurate, while the red darts are precise but inaccurate. \\nFigure 5.12 Accuracy and Precision \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  131 \\nSeveral types of error can arise when accuracy and/or precision requirements are not met during \\ndata capture and creation. Positional accuracy is the probability of a feature being within +/\u2212 units of \\neither its true location on earth (absolute positional accuracy) or its location in relation to other \\nmapped features (relative positional accuracy). For example, it could be said that a particular \\nmapping effort may result in 95 percent of trees being mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet for their true \\nlocation (absolute), or 95 percent of trees are mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet of their location as \\nobserved on a digital ortho quarter quadrangle (relative). \\nSpeaking about absolute positional error does beg the question, however, of what exactly is the true \\nlocation of an object? As discussed in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", differing conceptions of the earth\u2019s \\nshape has led to a plethora of projections, data points, and spheroids, each attempting to clarify \\npositional errors for particular locations on the earth. To begin addressing this unanswerable \\nquestion, the US National Map Accuracy Standard (or NMAS) suggests that to meet horizontal \\naccuracy requirements, a paper map is expected to have no more than 10 percent of measurable \\npoints fall outside the accuracy values range shown in Figure 5.13 \"Relation between Positional Error \\nand Scale\". Similarly, the vertical accuracy of no more than 10 percent of elevations on a contour \\nmap shall be in error of more than one-half the contour interval. Any map that does not meet these \\nhorizontal and vertical accuracy standards will be deemed unacceptable for publication. \\nFigure 5.13 Relation between Positional Error and Scale \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  132 \\nPositional errors arise via multiple sources. The process of digitizing paper maps commonly \\nintroduces such inaccuracies. Errors can arise while registering the map on the digitizing board. A \\npaper map can shrink, stretch, or tear over time, changing the dimensions of the scene. Input errors \\ncreated from hastily digitized points are common. Finally, converting between coordinate systems \\nand transforming between data points may also introduce errors to the dataset. \\nThe root-mean square (RMS) error is frequently used to evaluate the degree of inaccuracy in a \\ndigitized map. This statistic measures the deviation between the actual (true) and estimated \\n(digitized) locations of the control points. Figure 5.14 \"Potential Digitization Error\" illustrates the \\ninaccuracies of lines representing soil types that result from input control point location errors. By \\napplying an RMS error calculation to the dataset, one could determine the accuracy of the digitized \\nmap and thus determine its suitability for inclusion in a given study. \\nFigure 5.14 Potential Digitization Error \\n \\nPositional errors can also arise when features to be mapped are inherently vague. Take the example \\nof a wetland (Figure 5.15 \"Defining a Wetland Boundary\"). What defines a wetland boundary? \\nWetlands are determined by a combination of hydrologic, vegetative, and edaphic factors. Although \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers is currently responsible for defining the boundary of wetlands \\nthroughout the country, this task is not as simple as it may seem. In particular, regional differences \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  133 \\nin the characteristics of a wetland make delineating these features particularly troublesome. For \\nexample, the definition of a wetland boundary for the riverine wetlands in the eastern United States, \\nwhere water is abundant, is often useless when delineating similar types of wetlands in the desert \\nsouthwest United States. Indeed, the complexity and confusion associated with the conception of \\nwhat a \u201cwetland\u201d is may result in difficulties defining the feature in the field, which subsequently \\nleads to positional accuracy errors in the GIS database. \\nFigure 5.15 Defining a Wetland Boundary \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  134 \\nIn addition to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy is a common source of error in a GIS. Attribute \\nerrors can occur when an incorrect value is recorded within the attribute field or when a field is \\nmissing a value. Misspelled words and other typographical errors are common as well. Similarly, a \\ncommon inaccuracy occurs when developers enter \u201c0\u201d in an attribute field when the value is actually \\n\u201cnull.\u201d This is common in count data where \u201c0\u201d would represent zero findings, while a \u201cnull\u201d would \\nrepresent a locale where no data collection effort was undertaken. In the case of categorical values, \\ninaccuracies occasionally occur when attributes are mislabeled. For example, a land-use/land-cover \\nmap may list a polygon as \u201cagricultural\u201d when it is, in fact, \u201cresidential.\u201d This is particularly true if \\nthe dataset is out of date, which leads us to our next source of error. \\nTemporal accuracy addresses the age or timeliness of a dataset. No dataset is ever completely current. \\nIn the time it takes to create the dataset, it has already become outdated. Regardless, there are \\nseveral dates to be aware of while using a dataset. These dates should be found within the metadata. \\nThe publication date will tell you when the dataset was created and/or released. The field date relates \\nthe date and time the data was collected. If the dataset contains any future prediction, there should \\nalso be a forecast period and/or date. To address temporal accuracy, many datasets undergo a \\nregular data update regimen. For example, the California Department of Fish and Game updates its \\nsensitive species databases on a near monthly basis as new findings are continually being made. It is \\nimportant to ensure that, as an end-user, you are constantly using the most up-to-date data for your \\nGIS application. \\nThe fourth type of accuracy in a GIS is logical consistency. Logical consistency requires that the data \\nare topologically correct. For example, does a stream segment of a line shapefile fall within the \\nfloodplain of the corresponding polygon shapefile? Do roadways connect at nodes? Do all the \\nconnections and flows point in the correct direction in a network? In regards to the last question, the \\nauthor was recently using an unnamed smartphone application to navigate a busy city roadway and \\nwas twice told to turn the wrong direction down one-way streets. So beware, errors in logical \\nconsistency may lead to traffic violations, or worse! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  135 \\nThe final type of accuracy is data completeness. Comprehensive inclusion of all features within the \\nGIS database is required to ensure accurate mapping results. Simply put, all the data must be present \\nfor a dataset to be accurate. Are all of the counties in the state represented? Are all of the stream \\nsegments included in the river network? Is every convenience store listed in the database? Are only \\ncertain types of convenience stores listed within the database? Indeed, incomplete data will \\ninevitably lead to incomplete or insufficient analysis. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 All geospatial data contains error. \\n\u2022 Accuracy represents how close a measurement is to its actual value, while precision refers to the variance \\nof a value when repeated measurements are taken. \\n\u2022 The five types of error in a geospatial dataset are related to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, \\ntemporal accuracy, logical consistency, and data completeness. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the five types of accuracy/precision errors associated geographic information? Provide an \\nexample of each type of error. \\n2. Per the description of the positional accuracy of wetland boundaries, discuss a map feature whose \\nboundaries are inherently vague and difficult to map. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  136 \\nChapter 6 \\n \\nData Characteristics and Visualization \\nIn previous chapters, we learned how geographic information system (GIS) software packages use \\ndatabases to store extensive attribute information for geospatial features within a map. The true \\nusefulness of this information, however, is not realized until similarly powerful analytical tools are \\nemployed to access, process, and simplify the data. To accomplish this, GIS typically provides \\nextensive tools for searching, querying, describing, summarizing, and classifying datasets. With these \\ndata exploration tools, even the most expansive datasets can be mined to provide users the ability to \\nmake meaningful insights into and statements about that information. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  137 \\n6.1 Descriptions and Summaries \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review the most frequently used measures of distribution, central \\ntendency, and dispersion. \\nNo discussion of geospatial analysis would be complete without a brief overview of basic statistical \\nconcepts. The basic statistics outlined here represent a starting point for any attempt to describe, \\nsummarize, and analyze geospatial datasets. An example of a common geospatial statistical endeavor \\nis the analysis of point data obtained by a series of rainfall gauges patterned throughout a particular \\nregion. Given these rain gauges, one could determine the typical amount and variability of rainfall at \\neach station, as well as typical rainfall throughout the region as a whole. In addition, you could \\ninterpolate the amount of rainfall that falls between each station or the location where the most (or \\nleast) rainfall occurs. Furthermore, you could predict the expected amount of rainfall into the future \\nat each station, between each station, or within the region as a whole. \\nThe increase of computational power over the past few decades has given rise to vast datasets that \\ncannot be summarized easily. Descriptive statistics provide simple numeric descriptions of these large \\ndatasets. Descriptive statistics tend to be univariate analyses, meaning they examine one variable at a \\ntime. There are three families of descriptive statistics that we will discuss here: measures of \\ndistribution, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion. However, before we delve \\ntoo deeply into various statistical techniques, we must first define a few terms. \\n\u2022 Variable: a symbol used to represent any given value or set of values  \\n\u2022 Value: an individual observation of a variable (in a geographic information system [GIS] this is \\nalso called a record) \\n\u2022 Population: the universe of all possible values for a variable \\n\u2022 Sample: a subset of the population \\n\u2022 n: the number of observations for a variable \\n\u2022 Array: a sequence of observed measures (in a GIS this is also called a field and is represented in \\nan attribute table as a column) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  138 \\n\u2022 Sorted Array: an ordered, quantitative array \\nMeasures of Distribution \\nThe measure of distribution of a variable is merely a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset (hence, this is often called a frequency distribution). Typically, the values for the given variable \\nwill be grouped into a predetermined series of classes (also called intervals, bins, or categories), and the \\nnumber of data values that fall into each class will be summarized. A graph showing the number of data \\nvalues within each class range is called a histogram. For example, the percentage grades received by a \\nclass on an exam may result in the following array (n = 30): \\nArray of Exam Scores: {87, 76, 89, 90, 64, 67, 59, 79, 88, 74, 72, 99, 81, 77, 75, 86, 94, 66, 75, 74, 83, \\n100, 92, 75, 73, 70, 60, 80, 85, 57} \\nWhen placing this array into a frequency distribution, the following general guidelines should be \\nobserved. First, between five and fifteen different classes should be employed, although the exact number \\nof classes depends on the number of observations. Second, each observation goes into one and only one \\nclass. Third, when possible, use classes that cover an equal range of values (Freund and Perles \\n2006). [1] With these guidelines in mind, the exam score array shown earlier can be visualized  with the \\nfollowing histogram (Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ). \\nFigure 6.1 Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  139 \\nAs you can see from the histogram, certain descriptive observations can be readily made. Most students \\nreceived a C on the exam (70\u201379). Two students failed the exam (50\u201359). Five students received an A \\n(90\u201399). Note that this histogram does violate the third basic rule that each class cover an equal range \\nbecause an F grade ranges from 0\u201359, whereas the other grades have ranges of equal size. Regardless, in \\nthis case we are most concerned with describing the distribution of grades received during the exam. \\nTherefore, it makes perfect sense to create class ranges that best suit ou r individual needs. \\nMeasures of Central Tendency \\nWe can further explore the exam score array by applying measures of central tendency. There are three \\nprimary measures of central tendency: the mean, mode, and median. The mean, more commonly referred \\nto as the average, is the most often used measure of central tendency. To calculate the mean, simply add \\nall the values in the array and divide that sum by the number of observations. To return to the exam score \\nexample from earlier, the sum of that array is 2,340, and there are 30 observations (n = 30). So, the mean \\nis 2,340 / 30 = 78. \\nThe mode is the measure of central tendency that represents the most frequently occurring value in the \\narray. In the case of the exam scores, the mode of the array is 75 as this w as received by the most number \\nof students (three, in total). Finally, the median is the observation that, when the array is ordered from \\nlowest to highest, falls exactly in the center of the sorted array. More specifically, the median is the value \\nin the middle of the sorted array when there are an odd number of observations. Alternatively, when there \\nis an even number of observations, the median is calculated by finding the mean of the two central values. \\nIf the array of exam scores were reordered into a sorted array, the scores would be listed thusly:  \\nSorted Array of Exam Scores: {57, 59, 60, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72, 73, 74, 74, 75, 75, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, \\n83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 99} \\nSince n = 30 in this example, there are an even number of observations. Therefore, the mean of the two \\ncentral values (15th = 76 and 16th = 77) is used to calculate the median as described earlier, resulting in (76 \\n+ 77) / 2 = 76.5. Taken together, the mean, mode, and median represent the most basic ways to exam ine \\ntrends in a dataset. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  140 \\nMeasures of Dispersion \\nThe third type of descriptive statistics is measures of dispersion (also referred to as measures of \\nvariability). These measures describe the spread of data around the mean. The simplest measure of \\ndispersion is the range. The range equals the largest value minus in the dataset the smallest. In our case, \\nthe range is 99 \u2212 57 = 42. \\nThe interquartile range represents a slightly more sophisticated measure of dispersion. This method \\ndivides the data into quartiles. To accomplish this, the median is used to divide the sorted array into two \\nhalves. These halves are again divided into halves by their own median. The first quartile (Q1) is the \\nmedian of the lower half of the sorted array and is also referred to as the lower quartile. Q2 represents the \\nmedian. Q3 is the median of the upper half of the sorted array and is referred to as the upper quartile. The \\ndifference between the upper and lower quartile is the interquartile range. In the exam score example, Q1 \\n= 72.25 and Q3 = 86.75. Therefore, the interquartile range for this dataset is 86.75 \u2212 72.25 = 14.50.  \\nA third measure of dispersion is the variance (s2). To calculate the variance, subtract the raw value of each \\nexam score from the mean of the exam scores. As you may guess, some of the differences will be positive, \\nand some will be negative, resulting in the sum of differences equaling zero. As we are more interested in \\nthe magnitude of differences (or deviations) from the mean, one method to overcome this \u201czeroing\u201d \\nproperty is to square each deviation, thus removing the negative values from the output ( Figure 6.2). This \\nresults in the following: \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  141 \\nFigure 6.2 \\n \\nWe then divide the sum of squares by either n \u2212 1 (in the case of working with a sample) or n (in the case \\nof working with a population). As the exam scores given here represent the entire population of the class, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  142 \\nwe will employ Figure 6.3 \"Variance\", which results in a variance of s2 = 116.4. If we wanted to use these \\nexam scores to extrapolate information about the larger student body, we would be working with a sample \\nof the population. In that case, we would divide the sum of squares by  n \u2212 1. \\nFigure 6.3 Variance \\n \\nStandard deviation, the final measure of dispersion discussed here, is the most commonly used measure \\nof dispersion. To compensate for the squaring of each difference from the mean performed during the \\nvariance calculation, standard deviation takes the square root of the variance. As determined from Figure \\n6.4 \"Standard Deviation\", our exam score example results in a standard deviation of s = SQRT(116.4) = \\n10.8. \\nFigure 6.4 Standard Deviation \\n \\nCalculating the standard deviation allows us to make some notable inferences about the dispersion of our \\ndataset. A small standard deviation suggests the values in the dataset are clustered around the mean, \\nwhile a large standard deviation suggests the values are scattered widely around the mean. Additional \\ninferences may be made about the standard deviation if the dataset conforms to a normal distribution. A \\nnormal distribution implies that the data, when placed into a frequency distribution (histogram), looks \\nsymmetrical or \u201cbell-shaped.\u201d When not \u201cnormal,\u201d the frequency distribution of dataset is said to be \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  143 \\npositively or negatively \u201cskewed\u201d (Figure 6.5 \"Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and \\nNegatively Skewed Datasets\"). Skewed data are those that maintain values that are not symmetrical \\naround the mean. Regardless, normally distributed data maintains the property of having approxim ately \\n68 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 95 percent of the data \\nvalue fall within \u00b1 2 standard deviations of the mean. In our example, the mean is 78, and the standard \\ndeviation is 10.8. It can therefore be stated that 68 percent of the scores fall between 67.2 and 88.8 (i.e., \\n78 \u00b1 10.8), while 95 percent of the scores fall between 56.4 and 99.6 (i.e., 78 \u00b1 [10.8 * 2]). For datasets \\nthat do not conform to the normal curve, it can be assumed that 75 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 \\n2 standard deviations of the mean. \\nFigure 6.5 Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and Negatively Skewed Datasets \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The measure of distribution for a given variable is a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset and is commonly shown using a histogram. \\n\u2022 Measures of central tendency attempt to provide insights into \u201ctypical\u201d value for a dataset.  \\n\u2022 Measures of dispersion (or variability) describe the spread of data around the mean o r median. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to outline the basics of the SQL language and to understand the various \\nquery techniques available in a GIS. \\nAccess to robust search and query tools is essential to examine the general trends of a dataset.  Queries are \\nessentially questions posed to a database. The selective display and retrieval of information based on \\nthese queries are essential components of any geographic information system (GIS). There are three basic \\nmethods for searching and querying attribute data: (1) selection, (2) query by attribute, and (3) query by \\ngeography. \\nSelection \\nSelection represents the easiest way to search and query spatial data in a GIS. Sele cting features highlight \\nthose attributes of interest, both on-screen and in the attribute table, for subsequent display or analysis. \\nTo accomplish this, one selects points, lines, and polygons simply by using the cursor to \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d \\nthe feature of interest or by using the cursor to drag a box around those features. Alternatively, one can \\nselect features by using a graphic object, such as a circle, line, or polygon, to highlight all of those features \\nthat fall within the object. Advanced options for selecting subsets of data from the larger dataset include \\ncreating a new selection, selecting from the currently selected features, adding to the current selection, \\nand removing from the current selection. \\nQuery by Attribute \\nMap features and their associated data can be retrieved via the query of attribute information within the \\ndata tables. For example, search and query tools allow a user to show all the census tracts that have a \\npopulation density of 500 or greater, to show all counties that are less than or equal to 100 square \\nkilometers, or to show all convenience stores within 1 mile of an interstate highway.  \\nSpecifically, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a commonly used computer language developed to \\nquery attribute data within a relational database management system. Created by IBM in the 1970s, SQL Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  145 \\nallows for the retrieval of a subset of attribute information based on specific, user -defined criteria via the \\nimplementation of particular language elements. More recently, the use of SQL has been extended for use \\nin a GIS (Shekhar and Chawla 2003).[1] One important note related to the use of SQL is that the exact \\nexpression used to query a dataset depends on the GIS file format being examined. For example, ANSI \\nSQL is a particular version used to query ArcSDE geodatabases, while Jet SQL is used to access personal \\ngeodatabases. Similarly, shapefiles, coverages, and dBASE tables use a restricted version of SQL that \\ndoesn\u2019t support all the features of ANSI SQL or Jet SQL. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.2 \"Geospatial Database \\nManagement\", all attribute tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for an SQL \\nquery must contain primary and/or foreign keys for proper use. In addition to these keys, SQL \\nimplements clauses to structure database queries. A clause is a language element that includes the \\nSELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING query statements.  \\n\u2022 SELECT denotes what attribute table fields you wish to view. \\n\u2022 FROM denotes the attribute table in which the information resides.  \\n\u2022 WHERE denotes the user-defined criteria for the attribute information that must be met in order \\nfor it to be included in the output set. \\n\u2022 ORDER BY denotes the sequence in which the output set will be displayed.  \\n\u2022 HAVING denotes the predicate used to filter output from the ORDER BY clause.  \\nWhile the SELECT and FROM clauses are both mandatory statements in an SQL query, the WHERE is an \\noptional clause used to limit the output set. The ORDER BY and HAVING are optional clauses used to \\npresent the information in an interpretable manner. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  146 \\nFigure 6.6 Personal Addresses in \u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table \\n \\nThe following is a series of SQL expressions and results when applied to Figure 6.6 \"Personal Addresses in \\n\u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table\". The title of the attribute table is \u201cExampleTable.\u201d Note that the asterisk \\n(*) denotes a special case of SELECT whereby all columns for a given record are selected:  \\nSELECT * FROM ExampleTable WHERE City = \u201cUpland\u201d \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  147 \\nThis statement returns the following: \\n \\nConsider the following statement: \\nSELECT LastName FROM ExampleTable WHERE State = \u201cCA\u201d ORDER BY FirstName \\nThis statement results in the following table sorted in ascending order by the FirstName column (not \\nincluded in the output table as directed by the SELECT clause): \\n \\nIn addition to clauses, SQL allows for the inclusion of specific operators to further delimit the result of \\nquery. These operators can be relational, arithmetic, or Boolean and will typically appear inside of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  148 \\nconditional statements in the WHERE clause. A relational operator employs the statements equal to (=), \\nless than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), or greater than or equal to \\n(>=). Arithmetic operators are those mathematical functions that include addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), \\nmultiplication (*), and division (/). Boolean operators (also called Boolean connectors) include the \\nstatements AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. The AND connector is used to select records from the attribute \\ntable that satisfies both expressions. The OR connector selects records that satisfy either one or both \\nexpressions. The XOR connector selects records that satisfy one and only one of the expressions (the \\nfunctional opposite of the AND connector). Lastly, the NOT connector is used to negate (or unsele ct) an \\nexpression that would otherwise be true. Put into the language of probability, the AND connector is used \\nto represent an intersection, OR represents a union, and NOT represents a complement.  Figure 6.7 \"Venn \\nDiagram of SQL Operators\" illustrates the logic of these connectors, where circles A and B represent two \\nsets of intersecting data. Keep in mind that SQL is a very exacting language and minor inconsistencies in \\nthe statement, such as additional spaces, can result in a failed query.  \\nFigure 6.7 Venn Diagram of SQL Operators \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  149 \\nUsed together, these operators combine to provide the GIS user with powerful and flexible search and \\nquery options. With this in mind, can you determine the output set of the following SQL query as it is \\napplied to Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ? \\nSELECT LastName, FirstName, StreetNumber FROM ExampleTable WHERE StreetNumber >= 10000 \\nAND StreetNumber < 100 ORDER BY LastName \\nThe following are the results: \\n \\nQuery by Geography \\nQuery by geography, also known as a \u201cspatial query,\u201d allows one to highlight particular features by \\nexamining their position relative to other features. For example, a GIS provides robust tools that allow for \\nthe determination of the number of schools within 10 miles of a home. Several spatial query options are \\navailable, as outlined here. Throughout this discussion, the \u201ctarget layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset \\nwhose attributes are selected, while the \u201csource layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset on which the spatial \\nquery is applied. For example, if we were to use a state boundary polygon feature dataset to select \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  150 \\nhighways from a line feature dataset (e.g., select all the highways that run through the state of Arkansas), \\nthe state layer is the source, while the highway layer is the target.  \\n\u2022 INTERSECT. This oft-used spatial query technique selects all features in the target layer that \\nshare a common locale with the source layer. The \u201cintersect\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used as both the source and target layers (Figure 6.8). \\nFigure 6.8 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  151 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they intersect the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE WITHIN A DISTANCE OF. This technique requires the user to specify some distance \\nvalue, which is then used to buffer (Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", Section \\n7.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") the source layer. All features that intersect this buffer are \\nhighlighted in the target layer. The \u201care within a distance of\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used for both the source and target layers (Figure 6.9). \\nFigure 6.9 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  152 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are within the selected distance \\nof the red features; tan areas represent buffers around the various features. \\n\u2022 COMPLETELY CONTAIN. This spatial query technique returns those features that are entirely \\nwithin the source layer. Features with coincident boundaries are not selected by this query type. \\nThe \u201ccompletely contain\u201d query allows for points, lines, or polygons as the source layer, but only \\npolygons can be used as a target layer (Figure 6.10). \\nFigure 6.10 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they completely contain the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 ARE COMPLETELY WITHIN. This query selects those features in the target layer whose entire \\nspatial extent occurs within the geometry of the source layer.

This technique selects target features whose center, or centroid, is \\nlocated within the boundary of the source feature dataset.

The objective of this section is to describe the methodologies available to parse data into various classes \\nfor visual representation in a map. \\nThe process of data classification combines raw data into predefined classes, or bins. These classes \\nmay be represented in a map by some unique symbols or, in the case of choropleth maps, by a unique \\ncolor or hue (for more on color and hue, see Chapter 8 \"Geospatial Analysis II: Raster Data\", Section \\n8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"). Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated \\ncolors to represent some statistical variable of interest. Although seemingly straightforward, there \\nare several different classification methodologies available to a cartographer. These methodologies \\nbreak the attribute values down along various interval patterns. Monmonier (1991) [1]noted that \\ndifferent classification methodologies can have a major impact on the interpretability of a given map \\nas the visual pattern presented is easily distorted by manipulating the specific interval breaks of the \\nclassification. In addition to the methodology employed, the number of classes chosen to represent \\nthe feature of interest will also significantly affect the ability of the viewer to interpret the mapped \\ninformation. Including too many classes can make a map look overly complex and confusing. Too \\nfew classes can oversimplify the map and hide important data trends. Most effective classification \\nattempts utilize approximately four to six distinct classes. \\nWhile problems potentially exist with any classification technique, a well-constructed choropleth \\nincreases the interpretability of any given map. The following discussion outlines the classification \\nmethods commonly available in geographic information system (GIS) software packages. In these \\nexamples, we will use the US Census Bureau\u2019s population statistic for US counties in 1997. These \\ndata are freely available at the US Census website (http://www.census.gov). \\nThe equal interval (or equal step) classification method divides the range of attribute values into \\nequally sized classes. The number of classes is determined by the user. The equal interval \\nclassification method is best used for continuous datasets such as precipitation or temperature. In \\nthe case of the 1997 Census Bureau data, county population values across the United States range Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  162 \\nfrom 40 (Yellowstone National Park County, MO) to 9,184,770 (Los Angeles County, CA) for a total \\nrange of 9,184,770 \u2212 40 = 9,184,730. If we decide to classify this data into 5 equal interval classes, \\nthe range of each class would cover a population spread of 9,184,730 / 5 = 1,836,946 (Figure 6.19 \\n\"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data\"). The advantage of the equal \\ninterval classification method is that it creates a legend that is easy to interpret and present to a \\nnontechnical audience. The primary disadvantage is that certain datasets will end up with most of \\nthe data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will occupy the other \\nclasses. As you can see in Figure 6.19 \"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population \\nData\", almost all the counties are assigned to the first (yellow) bin. \\nFigure 6.19 Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  163 \\nThe quantile classification method places equal numbers of observations into each class. This method \\nis best for data that is evenly distributed across its range. Figure 6.20 \"Quantiles\" shows the quantile \\nclassification method with five total classes. As there are 3,140 counties in the United States, each \\nclass in the quantile classification methodology will contain 3,140 / 5 = 628 different counties. The \\nadvantage to this method is that it often excels at emphasizing the relative position of the data values \\n(i.e., which counties contain the top 20 percent of the US population). The primary disadvantage of \\nthe quantile classification methodology is that features placed within the same class can have wildly \\ndiffering values, particularly if the data are not evenly distributed across its range. In addition, the \\nopposite can also happen whereby values with small range differences can be placed into different \\nclasses, suggesting a wider difference in the dataset than actually exists. \\nFigure 6.20 Quantiles \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  164 \\nThe natural breaks (or Jenks) classification method utilizes an algorithm to group values in classes \\nthat are separated by distinct break points. This method is best used with data that is unevenly \\ndistributed but not skewed toward either end of the distribution. Figure 6.21 \"Natural Breaks\" shows \\nthe natural breaks classification for the 1997 US county population density data. One potential \\ndisadvantage is that this method can create classes that contain widely varying number ranges. \\nAccordingly, class 1 is characterized by a range of just over 150,000, while class 5 is characterized by \\na range of over 6,000,000. In cases like this, it is often useful to either \u201ctweak\u201d the classes following \\nthe classification effort or to change the labels to some ordinal scale such as \u201csmall, medium, or \\nlarge.\u201d The latter example, in particular, can result in a map that is more comprehensible to the \\nviewer. A second disadvantage is the fact that it can be difficult to compare two or more maps created \\nwith the natural breaks classification method because the class ranges are so very specific to each \\ndataset. In these cases, datasets that may not be overly disparate may appear so in the output \\ngraphic. \\nFigure 6.21 Natural Breaks \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  165 \\nFinally, the standard deviation classification method forms each class by adding and subtracting the \\nstandard deviation from the mean of the dataset. The method is best suited to be used with data that \\nconforms to a normal distribution. In the county population example, the mean is 85,108, and the \\nstandard deviation is 277,080. Therefore, as can be seen in the legend of Figure 6.22 \"Standard \\nDeviation\", the central class contains values within a 0.5 standard deviation of the mean, while the \\nupper and lower classes contain values that are 0.5 or more standard deviations above or below the \\nmean, respectively. \\nFigure 6.22 Standard Deviation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  166 \\nIn conclusion, there are several viable data classification methodologies that can be applied to \\nchoropleth maps. Although other methods are available (e.g., equal area, optimal), those outlined \\nhere represent the most commonly used and widely available. Each of these methods presents the \\ndata in a different fashion and highlights different aspects of the trends in the dataset. Indeed, the \\nclassification methodology, as well as the number of classes utilized, can result in very widely varying \\ninterpretations of the dataset. It is incumbent upon you, the cartographer, to select the method that \\nbest suits the needs of the study and presents the data in as meaningful and transparent a way as \\npossible. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated colors to represent some statistical variable \\nof interest. \\n\u2022 Four methods for classifying data presented here include equal intervals, quartile, natural breaks, and \\nstandard deviation. These methods convey certain advantages and disadvantages when visualizing a \\nvariable of interest. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Spatial analysis is a fundamental component of a GIS that allows for an in-\\ndepth study of the topological and geometric properties of a dataset or datasets. In this chapter, we \\ndiscuss the basic spatial analysis techniques for vector datasets. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  168 \\n7.1 Single Layer Analysis \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the variety of single \\noverlay analysis techniques available to analyze and manipulate the spatial attributes of a vector feature \\ndataset. \\nAs the name suggests, single layer analyses are those that are undertaken on an individual feature \\ndataset. Buffering is the process of creating an output polygon layer containing a zone (or zones) of a \\nspecified width around an input point, line, or polygon feature. Buffers are particularly suited for \\ndetermining the area of influence around features of interest. Geoprocessing is a suite of tools \\nprovided by many geographic information system (GIS) software packages that allow the user to \\nautomate many of the mundane tasks associated with manipulating GIS data. Geoprocessing usually \\ninvolves the input of one or more feature datasets, followed by a spatially explicit analysis, and \\nresulting in an output feature dataset. \\nBuffering \\nBuffers are common vector analysis tools used to address questions of proximity in a GIS and can be used \\non points, lines, or polygons (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features\" ). For \\ninstance, suppose that a natural resource manager wants to ensure that no areas are disturbed within \\n1,000 feet of breeding habitat for the federally endangered Delhi Sands flower- loving fly (Rhaphiomidas \\nterminatus abdominalis). This species is found only in the few remaining Delhi Sands soil formations of \\nthe western United States. To accomplish this task, a 1,000-foot protection zone (buffer) could be created \\naround all the observed point locations of the species. Alternatively, the manager may decide th at there is \\nnot enough point-specific location information related to this rare species and decide to protect all Delhi \\nSands soil formations. In this case, he or she could create a 1,000-foot buffer around all polygons labeled \\nas \u201cDelhi Sands\u201d on a soil formations dataset. In either case, the use of buffers provides a quick-and-easy \\ntool for determining which areas are to be maintained as preserved habitat for the endangered fly.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  169 \\nFigure 7.1 Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features \\n \\nSeveral buffering options are available to refine the output. For example, the buffer tool will typically \\nbuffer only selected features. If no features are selected, all features will be buffered. Two primary types of \\nbuffers are available to the GIS users: constant width and variable width. Constant width buffersrequire \\nusers to input a value by which features are buffered (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and \\nPolygon Features\"), such as is seen in the examples in the preceding paragraph. Variable width buffers, on \\nthe other hand, call on a premade buffer field within the attribute table to determine the buffer width for \\neach specific feature in the dataset (Figure 7.2 \"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) \\nVariable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple Ring Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) \\nNondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\"). \\nIn addition, users can choose to dissolve or not dissolve the boundaries between overlapping, coincident \\nbuffer areas. Multiple ring buffers can be made such that a series of concentric buffer zones (much like an \\narchery target) are created around the originating feature at user- specified distances (Figure 7.2 \\n\"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multi ple Ring Buffers, \\n(c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\" ). In the case of \\npolygon layers, buffers can be created that include the originating polygon feature as part of the buffer or \\nthey be created as a doughnut buffer that excludes the input polygon area. Setback buffers are similar to \\ndoughnut buffers; however, they only buffer the area inside of the polygon boundary. Linear features can \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  170 \\nbe buffered on both sides of the line, only on the left, or only on t he right. Linear features can also be \\nbuffered so that the end points of the line are rounded (ending in a half- circle) or flat (ending in a \\nrectangle). \\nFigure 7.2 Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple \\nRing Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer \\n \\nGeoprocessing Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  171 \\n\u201cGeoprocessing\u201d is a loaded term in the field of GIS. The term can (and should) be widely applied to any \\nattempt to manipulate GIS data. However, the term came into common usage due to its application to a \\nsomewhat arbitrary suite of single layer and multiple layer analytical techniques in the Geoprocessing \\nWizard of ESRI\u2019s ArcView software package in the mid-1990s. Regardless, the suite of geoprocessing tools \\navailable in a GIS greatly expand and simplify many of the management and manipulation processes \\nassociated with vector feature datasets. The primary use of these tools is to automate the repetitive \\npreprocessing needs of typical spatial analyses and to assemble exact graphical representations for \\nsubsequent analysis and/or inclusion in presentations and final mapping products. The union, intersect, \\nsymmetrical difference, and identity overlay methods discussed in Section 7.2.2 \"Other Multilayer \\nGeoprocessing Options\" are often used in conjunction with these geoprocessing tools. The following \\nrepresents the most common geoprocessing tools. \\nThe dissolve operation combines adjacent polygon features in a single feature dataset based o n a single \\npredetermined attribute. For example, part (a) ofFigure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing \\nFunctions\" shows the boundaries of seven different parcels of land, owned by four different families \\n(labeled 1 through 4). The dissolve tool automatically combines all adjacent features with the same \\nattribute values. The result is an output layer with the same extent as the original but without all of the \\nunnecessary, intervening line segments. The dissolved output layer is much easier to visually interpret \\nwhen the map is classified according to the dissolved field. \\nThe append operation creates an output polygon layer by combining the spatial extent of two or more \\nlayers (part (d) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). For use with point, line, and \\npolygon datasets, the output layer will be the same feature type as the input layers (which must each be \\nthe same feature type as well). Unlike the dissolve tool, append does not remove the boundary lines \\nbetween appended layers (in the case of lines and polygons). Therefore, it is often useful to perform a \\ndissolve after the use of the append tool to remove these potentially unnecessary dividing lines. Append is \\nfrequently used to mosaic data layers, such as digital US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5- minute \\ntopographic maps, to create a single map for analysis and/or display.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  172 \\nThe select operation creates an output layer based on a user-defined query that selects particular features \\nfrom the input layer (part (f) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). The output layer \\ncontains only those features that are selected during the query. For example, a city planner may choose to \\nperform a select on all areas that are zoned \u201cresidential\u201d so he or she can quickly assess which areas in \\ntown are suitable for a proposed housing development. \\nFinally, the merge operation combines features within a point, line, or polygon layer into a single feature \\nwith identical attribute information. Often, the original features will have different values for a given \\nattribute. In this case, the first attribute encountered is carried over into the attribute table, and the \\nremaining attributes are lost. This operation is particularly useful when polygons are found to be \\nunintentionally overlapping. Merge will conveniently combine these features into a single entity. \\nFigure 7.3 Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Buffers are frequently used to create zones of a specified width around points, lines, and polygons.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  173 \\n\u2022 Vector buffering options include constant or variable widths, multiple rings, doughnuts, setbacks, and \\ndissolve. \\n\u2022 Common single layer geoprocessing operations on vector layers include dissolve, merge, append, and \\nselect. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the implementation \\nof basic multiple layer operations and methodologies used on vector feature datasets.  \\nAmong the most powerful and commonly used tools in a geographic information system (GIS) is the \\noverlay of cartographic information. In a GIS, an overlay is the process of taking two or more \\ndifferent thematic maps of the same area and placing them on top of one another to form a new map \\n(Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector Layers, as \\nWell as Raster Layers\"). Inherent in this process, the overlay function combines not only the spatial \\nfeatures of the dataset but also the attribute information as well. \\nFigure 7.4 A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector \\nLayers, as Well as Raster Layers \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  175 \\nA common example used to illustrate the overlay process is, \u201cWhere is the best place to put a mall?\u201d \\nImagine you are a corporate bigwig and are tasked with determining where your company\u2019s next \\nshopping mall will be placed. How would you attack this problem? With a GIS at your command, \\nanswering such spatial questions begins with amassing and overlaying pertinent spatial data layers. \\nFor example, you may first want to determine what areas can support the mall by accumulating \\ninformation on which land parcels are for sale and which are zoned for commercial development. \\nAfter collecting and overlaying the baseline information on available development zones, you can \\nbegin to determine which areas offer the most economic opportunity by collecting regional \\ninformation on average household income, population density, location of proximal shopping \\ncenters, local buying habits, and more. Next, you may want to collect information on restrictions or \\nroadblocks to development such as the cost of land, cost to develop the land, community response to \\ndevelopment, adequacy of transportation corridors to and from the proposed mall, tax rates, and so \\nforth. Indeed, simply collecting and overlaying spatial datasets provides a valuable tool for \\nvisualizing and selecting the optimal site for such a business endeavor. \\nOverlay Operations \\nSeveral basic overlay processes are available in a GIS for vector datasets: point -in-polygon, polygon-on-\\npoint, line-on-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-on-polygon. As you may be able to \\ndivine from the names, one of the overlay dataset must always be a line or polygon layer, while the second \\nmay be point, line, or polygon. The new layer produced following the overlay operation is termed the \\n\u201coutput\u201d layer. \\nThe point-in-polygon overlay operation requires a point input layer and a polygon overlay layer. Upon \\nperforming this operation, a new output point layer is returned that includes  all the points that occur \\nwithin the spatial extent of the overlay (Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, \\nLine, and Polygon Vector Layers, as Well as Raster Layers\"). In addition, all the points in the output layer \\ncontain their original attribute information as well as the attribute information from the overlay. For \\nexample, suppose you were tasked with determining if an endangered species residing in a national park \\nwas found primarily in a particular vegetation community. The first step would be to acquire the point Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  176 \\noccurrence locales for the species in question, plus a polygon overlay layer showing the vegetation \\ncommunities within the national park boundary. Upon performing the point -in-polygon overlay \\noperation, a new point file is created that contains all the points that occur within the national park. The \\nattribute table of this output point file would also contain information about the vegetation communities \\nbeing utilized by the species at the time of observation. A quick sca n of this output layer and its attribute \\ntable would allow you to determine where the species was found in the park and to review the vegetation \\ncommunities in which it occurred. This process would enable park employees to make informed \\nmanagement decisions regarding which onsite habitats to protect to ensure continued site utilization by \\nthe species. \\nFigure 7.5 Point-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nAs its name suggests, the polygon-on-point overlay operation is the opposite of the point-in-polygon \\noperation. In this case, the polygon layer is the input, while the point layer is the overlay. The polygon \\nfeatures that overlay these points are selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For  \\nexample, given a point dataset containing the locales of some type of crime and a polygon dataset \\nrepresenting city blocks, a polygon-on-point overlay operation would allow police to select the city blocks \\nin which crimes have been known to occur and hence determine those locations where an increased police \\npresence may be warranted. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  177 \\nFigure 7.6 Polygon-on-Point Overlay \\n \\nA line-on-line overlay operation requires line features for both the input and overlay layer. The output \\nfrom this operation is a point or points located precisely at the intersection(s) of the two linear datasets \\n(Figure 7.7 \"Line-on-Line Overlay\"). For example, a linear feature dataset containing railroad tracks may \\nbe overlain on linear road network. The resulting point dataset contain s all the locales of the railroad \\ncrossings over a town\u2019s road network. The attribute table for this railroad crossing point dataset would \\ncontain information on both the railroad and the road over which it passed.  \\nFigure 7.7 Line-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nThe line-in-polygon overlay operation is similar to the point-in-polygon overlay, with that obvious \\nexception that a line input layer is used instead of a point input layer. In this case, each line that has any \\npart of its extent within the overlay polygon layer will be included in the output line layer, although these \\nlines will be truncated at the boundary of the overlay (Figure 7.9 \"Polygon-on-Line Overlay\"). For \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  178 \\nexample, a line-in-polygon overlay can take an input layer of interstate line segments and a polygon \\noverlay representing city boundaries and produce a linear output layer of highway segments that fall \\nwithin the city boundary. The attribute table for the output interstate line segment will contain \\ninformation on the interstate name as well as the city through which they pass. \\nFigure 7.8 Line-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe polygon-on-line overlay operation is the opposite of the line-in-polygon operation. In this case, the \\npolygon layer is the input, while the line layer is the overlay. The polygon featu res that overlay these lines \\nare selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For example, given a layer containing the \\npath of a series of telephone poles/wires and a polygon map contain city parcels, a polygon -on-line \\noverlay operation would allow a land assessor to select those parcels containing overhead telephone wires.  \\nFigure 7.9 Polygon-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  179 \\nFinally, the polygon-in-polygon overlay operation employs a polygon input and a polygon overlay. This is \\nthe most commonly used overlay operation. Using this method, the polygon input and overlay layers are \\ncombined to create an output polygon layer with the extent of the overlay. The attribute table will contain \\nspatial data and attribute information from both the input and overlay layers ( Figure 7.10 \"Polygon-in-\\nPolygon Overlay\"). For example, you may choose an input polygon layer of soil types with an overlay of \\nagricultural fields within a given county. The output polygon layer would contain information on both the \\nlocation of agricultural fields and soil types throughout the county.  \\nFigure 7.10 Polygon-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe overlay operations discussed previously assume that the user desires the overlain layers to be \\ncombined. This is not always the case. Overlay methods can be more complex than that and therefore \\nemploy the basic Boolean operators: AND, OR, and XOR (see Section 6.1.2 \"Measures of Central \\nTendency\"). Depending on which operator(s) are utilized, the overlay method employed will result in an \\nintersection, union, symmetrical difference, or identity. \\nSpecifically, the union overlay method employs the OR operator. A union can be used only in the case of \\ntwo polygon input layers. It preserves all features, attribute information, and spatial extents from both \\ninput layers (part (a) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). This overlay method is based on the \\npolygon-in-polygon operation described in Section 7.1.1 \"Buffering\". \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  180 \\nAlternatively, the intersection overlay method employs the AND operator. An intersection requires a \\npolygon overlay, but can accept a point, line, or polygon input. The output layer covers the spatial extent \\nof the overlay and contains features and attributes from both the input and overlay (part (b) of Figure 7.11 \\n\"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nThe symmetrical difference overlay method employs the XOR operator, which results in the opposite \\noutput as an intersection. This method requires both input layers to be polygons. The output polygon \\nlayer produced by the symmetrical difference method represents those areas common to only one of the \\nfeature datasets (part (c) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nIn addition to these simple operations, the identity (also referred to as \u201cminus\u201d) overlay method creates \\nan output layer with the spatial extent of the input layer (part (d) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \\n\") but includes attribute information from the overlay (referred to as the \u201cidentity\u201d layer, in this case). The \\ninput layer can be points, lines, or polygons. The identity layer must be a p olygon dataset. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  181 \\nFigure 7.11 Vector Overlay Methods \\n \\nOther Multilayer Geoprocessing Options \\nIn addition to the aforementioned vector overlay methods, other common multiple layer geoprocessing \\noptions are available to the user. These included the clip, erase, and split tools. The  clip geoprocessing \\noperation is used to extract those features from an input point, line, or polygon layer that falls within the \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  182 \\nspatial extent of the clip layer (part (e) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). Following the clip, all \\nattributes from the preserved portion of the input layer are included in the output. If any features are \\nselected during this process, only those selected features within the clip boundary will be included in the \\noutput. For example, the clip tool could be used to clip the extent of a river floodplain by the extent of a \\ncounty boundary. This would provide county managers with insight into which portions of the floodplain \\nthey are responsible to maintain. This is similar to the intersect overlay method; however, the attribute \\ninformation associated with the clip layer is not carried into the output layer following the overlay.  \\nThe erase geoprocessing operation is essentially the opposite of a clip. Whereas the clip tool preserves \\nareas within an input layer, the erase tool preserves only those areas outside the extent of the analogous \\nerase layer (part (f) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). While the input layer can be a point, line, or \\npolygon dataset, the erase layer must be a polygon dataset. Continuing with our clip example, county \\nmanagers could then use the erase tool to erase the areas of private ownership within the county \\nfloodplain area. Officials could then focus specifically on public reaches of the countywide floodplain for \\ntheir upkeep and maintenance responsibilities. \\nThe split geoprocessing operation is used to divide an input layer into two or more layers based on a split \\nlayer (part (g) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). The split layer must be a polygon, while the input \\nlayers can be point, line, or polygon. For example, a homeowner\u2019s association may choose to split up a \\ncountywide soil series map by parcel boundaries so each homeowner has a specific soil map for their own \\nparcel. \\nSpatial Join \\nA spatial join is a hybrid between an attribute operation and a vector overlay operation. Like the \u201cjoin\u201d \\nattribute operation described in Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\", a spatial join results in the combination \\nof two feature dataset tables by a common attribute field. Unlike the attribute operation, a spatial join \\ndetermines which fields from a source layer\u2019s attribute table are appended to the destination layer\u2019s \\nattribute table based on the relative locations of selected features. This relationship is explicitly based on \\nthe property of proximity or containment between the source and destination layers, rather than the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  183 \\nprimary or secondary keys. The proximity option is used when the source layer is a point or line feature \\ndataset, while the containment option is used when the source layer is a polygon feature dataset. \\nWhen employing the proximity (or \u201cnearest\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the closest given feature in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table. The \\nproximity option will typically add a numerical field to the destination layer attribute table, called \\n\u201cDistance,\u201d within which the measured distance between the source and destination feature is placed. For \\nexample, suppose a city agency had a point dataset showing all known polluters in town and a line dataset \\nof all the river segments within the municipal boundary. This agency could then perform a proximity -\\nbased spatial join to determine the nearest river segment that would most likely be affected by each \\npolluter. \\nWhen using the containment (or \u201cinside\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the polygon source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the record in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table that it contains. If a \\ndestination layer feature (point, line, or polygon) is not completely contained within a source polygon, no \\nvalue will be appended. For example, suppose a pool cleaning business wanted to hone its marketing \\nservices by providing flyers only to homes that owned a pool. They could obtain a point dataset containing \\nthe location of every pool in the county and a polygon parcel map for that same area. That business could \\nthen conduct a spatial join to append the parcel information to the pool locales. This would provide them \\nwith information on the each land parcel that contained a pool and they could subsequently send their \\nmailers only to those homes. \\nOverlay Errors \\nAlthough overlays are one of the most important tools in a GIS analyst\u2019s toolbox, there are some problems \\nthat can arise when using this methodology. In particular, slivers are a common error produced when two \\nslightly misaligned vector layers are overlain (Figure 7.12 \"Slivers\"). This misalignment can come from \\nseveral sources including digitization errors, interpretation errors, or source map errors (Chang \\n2008). [1] For example, most vegetation and soil maps are created from field survey data, satellite images, \\nand aerial photography. While you can imagine that the boundaries of soils and vegetation frequently \\ncoincide, the fact that they were most likely created by different researchers at different times suggests Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  184 \\nthat their boundaries will not perfectly overlap. To ameliorate this problem, GIS software incorporates \\nacluster tolerance option that forces nearby lines to be snapped together if they fall within a user-specified \\ndistance. Care must be taken when assigning cluster tolerance. Too strict a setting will not snap shared \\nboundaries, while too lenient a setting will snap unintended, neighboring boundaries together (Wang and  \\nDonaghy 1995). [2] \\nFigure 7.12 Slivers \\n \\nA second potential source of error associated with the overlay process is error \\npropagation. Error propagation arises when inaccuracies are present in the original input and overlay \\nlayers and are propagated through to the output layer (MacDougall 1975).  [3] These errors can be related to \\npositional inaccuracies of the points, lines, or polygons. Alternatively, they can arise from attribute errors \\nin the original data table(s). Regardless of the source, error propagation represents a common problem in \\noverlay analysis, the impact of which depends largely on the accuracy and precision requirements of the \\nproject at hand. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, polygon-on-point, line-\\non-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-in-polygon models. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  185 \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Raster data are particularly suited to certain \\ntypes of analyses, such as basic geoprocessing (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"), \\nsurface analysis (Section 8.2 \"Scale of Analysis\"), and terrain mapping (Section 8.3 \"Surface \\nAnalysis: Spatial Interpolation\"). While not always true, raster data can simplify many types of \\nspatial analyses that would otherwise be overly cumbersome to perform on vector datasets. Some of \\nthe most common of these techniques are presented in this chapter. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  187 \\n8.1 Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to become familiar with basic single and multiple raster geoprocessing \\ntechniques. \\nLike the geoprocessing tools available for use on vector datasets (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing \\nwith Rasters\"), raster data can undergo similar spatial operations. Although the actual computation \\nof these operations is significantly different from their vector counterparts, their conceptual \\nunderpinning is similar. The geoprocessing techniques covered here include both single layer \\n(Section 8.1.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\") and multiple layer (Section 8.1.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") \\noperations. \\nSingle Layer Analysis \\nReclassifying, or recoding, a dataset is commonly one of the first steps undertaken during raster analysis. \\nReclassification is basically the single layer process of assigning a new class or range value to all pixels in \\nthe dataset based on their original values (Figure 8.1 \"Raster Reclassification\". For example, an elevation \\ngrid commonly contains a different value for nearly every cell within its extent. These values could be \\nsimplified by aggregating each pixel value in a few discrete classes (i.e., 0 \u2013100 = \u201c1,\u201d 101\u2013200 = \u201c2,\u201d 201\u2013\\n300 = \u201c3,\u201d etc.). This simplification allows for fewer unique values and cheaper storage requirements. In \\naddition, these reclassified layers are often used as inputs in secondary analyses, such as those discussed \\nlater in this section. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  188 \\nFigure 8.1 Raster Reclassification \\n \\nAs described in Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", buffering is the process of creating \\nan output dataset that contains a zone (or zones) of a specified width around an input feature. In the case \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  189 \\nof raster datasets, these input features are given as a grid cell or a group of grid cells containing a uniform  \\nvalue (e.g., buffer all cells whose value = 1). Buffers are particularly suited for determining the area of \\ninfluence around features of interest. Whereas buffering vector data results in a precise area of influence \\nat a specified distance from the target feature, raster buffers tend to be approximations representing those \\ncells that are within the specified distance range of the target (Figure 8.2 \"Raster Buffer around a Target \\nCell(s)\"). Most geographic information system (GIS) programs calculate raster buffers by creating a grid \\nof distance values from the center of the target cell(s) to the center of the neighboring cells and then \\nreclassifying those distances such that a \u201c1\u201d represents those cells composing the original target, a \u201c2\u201d \\nrepresents those cells within the user-defined buffer area, and a \u201c0\u201d represents those cells outside of the \\ntarget and buffer areas. These cells could also be further classified to represent multiple ring buffers by \\nincluding values of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d \u201c5,\u201d and so forth, to represent concentric distances around the target cell(s). \\nFigure 8.2 Raster Buffer around a Target Cell(s) \\n \\nMultiple Layer Analysis \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  190 \\nA raster dataset can also be clipped similar to a vector dataset (Figure 8.3 \"Clipping a Raster to a Vector \\nPolygon Layer\"). Here, the input raster is overlain by a vector polygon clip layer. The raster clip process \\nresults in a single raster that is identical to the input raster but shares the extent of the polygon clip layer.  \\nFigure 8.3 Clipping a Raster to a Vector Polygon Layer \\n \\nRaster overlays are relatively simple compared to their vector counterparts and require much less \\ncomputational power (Burroughs 1983). [1] Despite their simplicity, it is important to ensure that all \\noverlain rasters are coregistered (i.e., spatially aligned), cover identical areas, and maintain equal \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  191 \\nresolution (i.e., cell size). If these assumptions are violated, the analysis will either fail or the resulting \\noutput layer will be flawed. With this in mind, there are several different methodologies for performing a \\nraster overlay (Chrisman 2002). [2] \\nThe mathematical raster overlay is the most common overlay method. The numbers within the aligned \\ncells of the input grids can undergo any user-specified mathematical transformation. Following the \\ncalculation, an output raster is produced that contains a new value for each cell ( Figure 8.4 \"Mathematical \\nRaster Overlay\"). As you can imagine, there are many uses for such functionality. In particular, raster \\noverlay is often used in risk assessment studies where various layers are combined to produce an outcome \\nmap showing areas of high risk/reward. \\nFigure 8.4 Mathematical Raster Overlay \\n \\nTwo input raster layers are overlain to produce an output raster with summed cell values. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  192 \\nThe Boolean raster overlay method represents a second powerful technique. As discussed in Chapter 6 \\n\"Data Characteristics and Visualization\", the Boolean connectors AND, OR, and XOR can be employed to \\ncombine the information of two overlying input raster datasets into a single output raste r. Similarly, the \\nrelational raster overlay method utilizes relational operators (<, <=, =, <>, >, and =>) to evaluate \\nconditions of the input raster datasets. In both the Boolean and relational overlay methods, cells that meet \\nthe evaluation criteria are typically coded in the output raster layer with a 1, while those evaluated as false \\nreceive a value of 0. \\nThe simplicity of this methodology, however, can also lead to easily overlooked errors in interpretation if \\nthe overlay is not designed properly. Assume that a natural resource manager has two input raster \\ndatasets she plans to overlay; one showing the location of trees (\u201c0\u201d = no tree; \u201c1\u201d = tree) and one showing \\nthe location of urban areas (\u201c0\u201d = not urban; \u201c1\u201d = urban). If she hopes to find the location of trees in \\nurban areas, a simple mathematical sum of these datasets will yield a \u201c2\u201d in all pixels containing a tree in \\nan urban area. Similarly, if she hopes to find the location of all treeless (or \u201cnon-tree,\u201d nonurban areas, \\nshe can examine the summed output raster for all \u201c0\u201d entries. Finally, if she hopes to locate urban, treeless \\nareas, she will look for all cells containing a \u201c1.\u201d Unfortunately, the cell value \u201c1\u201d also is coded into each \\npixel for nonurban, tree cells. Indeed, the choice of input pixel values and overlay equation in this \\nexample will yield confounding results due to the poorly devised overlay scheme.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, line-in-polygon, or \\npolygon-in-polygon models. \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\n\u2022 Raster overlay operations can employ powerful mathematical, Boolean, or relational operators to create \\nnew output datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

New York: John Wiley and Sons. \\n8.2 Scale of Analysis \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to understand how local, neighborhood, zonal, and global analyses can be \\napplied to raster datasets. \\nRaster analyses can be undertaken on four different scales of operation: local, neighborhood, zonal, \\nand global. Each of these presents unique options to the GIS analyst and are presented here in this \\nsection. \\nLocal Operations \\nLocal operations can be performed on single or multiple rasters. When used on a single raster, a local \\noperation usually takes the form of applying some mathematical transformation to each individual cell in \\nthe grid. For example, a researcher may obtain a digital elevation model (DEM) with each cell value \\nrepresenting elevation in feet. If it is preferred to represent those elevations in meters, a simple, \\narithmetic transformation (original elevation in feet * 0.3048 = new elevation in meters) of each cell value \\ncan be performed locally to accomplish this task. \\nWhen applied to multiple rasters, it becomes possible to perform such analyses as changes over time. \\nGiven two rasters containing information on groundwater depth on a parcel of land at Year 2000 and \\nYear 2010, it is simple to subtract these values and place the difference in an output raster that will note \\nthe change in groundwater between those two times (Figure 8.5 \"Local Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nThese local analyses can become somewhat more complicated however, as the number  of input rasters \\nincrease. For example, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) applies a local mathematical formula to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  194 \\nseveral overlying rasters including rainfall intensity, erodibility of the soil, slope, cultivation type, and \\nvegetation type to determine the average soil loss (in tons) in a grid cell. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  195 \\nFigure 8.5 Local Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nNeighborhood Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  196 \\nTobler\u2019s first law of geography states that \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are \\nmore related than distant things.\u201d Neighborhood operations represent a group of frequently used spatial \\nanalysis techniques that rely heavily on this concept. Neighborhood functions examine the relationship of \\nan object with similar surrounding objects. They can be performed on point, line, or polygon vector \\ndatasets as well as on raster datasets. In the case of vector datasets, neighborhood analysis is most \\nfrequently used to perform basic searches. For example, given a point dataset co ntaining the location of \\nconvenience stores, a GIS could be employed to determine the number of stores within 5 miles of a linear \\nfeature (i.e., Interstate 10 in California). \\nNeighborhood analyses are often more sophisticated when used with raster datasets. Raster analyses \\nemploy moving windows, also called filters or kernels, to calculate new cell values for every location \\nthroughout the raster layer\u2019s extent. These moving windows can take many different forms depending on \\nthe type of output desired and the phenomena being examined. For example, a rectangular, 3-by-3 \\nmoving window is commonly used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum, maximum, \\nor range of values immediately surrounding a given \u201ctarget\u201d cell (Figure 8.6 \"Common Neighborhood \\nTypes around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). Thetarget cell is that cell \\nfound in the center of the 3-by-3 moving window. The moving window passes over every cell in the raster. \\nAs it passes each central target cell, the nine values in the 3-by-3 window are used to calculate a new value \\nfor that target cell. This new value is placed in the identical location in the output raster. If one wanted to \\nexamine a larger sphere of influence around the target cells, the moving wi ndow could be expanded to 5 \\nby 5, 7 by 7, and so forth. Additionally, the moving window need not be a simple rectangle. Other shapes \\nused to calculate neighborhood statistics include the annulus, wedge, and circle ( Figure 8.6 \"Common \\nNeighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  197 \\nFigure 8.6 Common Neighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, \\n(d) Wedge \\n \\nNeighborhood operations are commonly used for data simplification on rast er datasets. An analysis that \\naverages neighborhood values would result in a smoothed output raster with dampened highs and lows as \\nthe influence of the outlying data values are reduced by the averaging process. Alternatively, \\nneighborhood analyses can be used to exaggerate differences in a dataset. Edge enhancement is a type of \\nneighborhood analysis that examines the range of values in the moving window. A large range value \\nwould indicate that an edge occurs within the extent of the window, while a small r ange indicates the lack \\nof an edge. \\nZonal Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  198 \\nA zonal operation is employed on groups of cells of similar value or like features, not surprisingly called \\nzones (e.g., land parcels, political/municipal units, waterbodies, soil/vegetation types). Thes e zones could \\nbe conceptualized as raster versions of polygons. Zonal rasters are often created by reclassifying an input \\nraster into just a few categories (see Section 8.2.2 \"Neighborhood Operations\" ). Zonal operations may be \\napplied to a single raster or two overlaying rasters. Given a single input raster, zonal operations measure \\nthe geometry of each zone in the raster, such as area, perimeter, thickness, and centroid. Given two rasters \\nin a zonal operation, one input raster and one zonal raster, a zonal operation produces an output raster, \\nwhich summarizes the cell values in the input raster for each zone in the zonal raster ( Figure 8.7 \"Zonal \\nOperation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.7 Zonal Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nZonal operations and analyses are valuable in fields of study such as landscape ecology where the \\ngeometry and spatial arrangement of habitat patches can significantly affect the type and number of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  199 \\nspecies that can reside in them. Similarly, zonal analyses can effectively quantify the narrow habitat \\ncorridors that are important for regional movement of flightless, migratory animal species moving \\nthrough otherwise densely urbanized areas. \\nGlobal Operations \\nGlobal operations are similar to zonal operations whereby the entire raster dataset\u2019s extent represents a \\nsingle zone. Typical global operations include determining basic statistical values for the raster as a whole. \\nFor example, the minimum, maximum, average, range, and so forth can be quickly calculated over th e \\nentire extent of the input raster and subsequently be output to a raster in which every cell contains that \\ncalculated value (Figure 8.8 \"Global Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.8 Global Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  200 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Local raster operations examine only a single target cell during analysis.  \\n\u2022 Neighborhood raster operations examine the relationship of a target cell proximal surrounding cells.  \\n\u2022 Zonal raster operations examine groups of cells that occur within a uniform feature type.  \\n\u2022 Global raster operations examine the entire areal extent of the dataset.  \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to GIS surfaces, how to \\ncreate them, and how they are used to answer specific spatial questions.  \\nA surface is a vector or raster dataset that contains an attribute value for every locale throughout its \\nextent. In a sense, all raster datasets are surfaces, but not all vector datasets are surfaces. Surfaces \\nare commonly used in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize phenomena such as \\nelevation, temperature, slope, aspect, rainfall, and more. In a GIS, surface analyses are usually \\ncarried out on either raster datasets or TINs (Triangular Irregular Network; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial \\nData Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File Formats\"), but isolines or point arrays can also be \\nused. Interpolation is used to estimate the value of a variable at an unsampled location from \\nmeasurements made at nearby or neighboring locales. Spatial interpolation methods draw on the \\ntheoretical creed of Tobler\u2019s first law of geography, which states that \u201ceverything is related to \\neverything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d Indeed, this basic tenet \\nof positive spatial autocorrelation forms the backbone of many spatial analyses (Figure 8.9 \"Positive \\nand Negative Spatial Autocorrelation\"). \\nFigure 8.9 Positive and Negative Spatial Autocorrelation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  202 \\nCreating Surfaces \\nThe ability to create a surface is a valuable tool in a GIS. The creation of raster surfaces, however, often \\nstarts with the creation of a vector surface. One common method to create such a vector surface from \\npoint data is via the generation of Thiessen (or Voronoi) polygons. Thiessen polygons are mathematically \\ngenerated areas that define the sphere of influence around each point in the dataset relative to all other \\npoints (Figure 8.10 \"A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons\" ). Specifically, polygon \\nboundaries are calculated as the perpendicular bisectors of the lines between e ach pair of neighboring \\npoints. The derived Thiessen polygons can then be used as crude vector surfaces that provide attribute \\ninformation across the entire area of interest. A common example of Thiessen polygons is the creation of a \\nrainfall surface from an array of rain gauge point locations. Employing some basic reclassification \\ntechniques, these Thiessen polygons can be easily converted to equivalent raster representations.  \\nFigure 8.10 A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons \\n \\nWhile the creation of Thiessen polygons results in a polygon layer whereby each polygon, or raster zone, \\nmaintains a single value, interpolation is a potentially complex statistical technique that estimates the \\nvalue of all unknown points between the known points. The three basic methods used to create \\ninterpolated surfaces are spline, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and trend surface. The spline \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  203 \\ninterpolation method forces a smoothed curve through the set of known input points to estimate the \\nunknown, intervening values. IDW interpolation estimates the values of unknown locations using the \\ndistance to proximal, known values. The weight placed on the value of each proximal value is in inverse \\nproportion to its spatial distance from the target locale. Therefore, the farther the proximal point, the less \\nweight it carries in defining the target point\u2019s value. Finally, trend surface interpolation is the most \\ncomplex method as it fits a multivariate statistical regression model to the known points, assigning a value \\nto each unknown location based on that model. \\nOther highly complex interpolation methods exist such as kriging. Kriging is a complex geostatistical \\ntechnique, similar to IDW, that employs semivariograms to interpolate the values of an input point layer \\nand is more akin to a regression analysis (Krige 1951). [1] The specifics of the kriging methodology will not \\nbe covered here as this is beyond the scope of this text. For more information on kriging, consult review \\ntexts such as Stein (1999). [2] \\nInversely, raster data can also be used to create vector surfaces. For instance, isoline maps are made up of \\ncontinuous, nonoverlapping lines that connect points of equal value. Isolines have specific monikers \\ndepending on the type of information they model (e.g., elevation = contour lines, temperature = \\nisotherms, barometric pressure = isobars, wind speed = isotachs) Figure 8.11 \"Contour Lines Derived \\nfrom a DEM\" shows an isoline elevation map. As the elevation values of this digital elevation model \\n(DEM) range from 450 to 950 feet, the contour lines are placed at 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 feet \\nelevations throughout the extent of the image. In this example, the contour interval, defined as the vertical \\ndistance between each contour line, is 100 feet. The contour interval is determined by the user during the \\ncreating of the surface. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  204 \\nFigure 8.11 Contour Lines Derived from a DEM \\n \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Spatial interpolation is used to estimate those unknown values found between known data points.  \\n\u2022 Spatial autocorrelation is positive when mapped features are clustered and is negative when mapped \\nfeatures are uniformly distributed. \\n\u2022 Thiessen polygons are a valuable tool for converting point arrays into polygon surfaces.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to learn to apply basic raster surface analyses to terrain mapping \\napplications. \\nSurface analysis is often referred to as terrain (elevation) analysis when information related to slope, \\naspect, viewshed, hydrology, volume, and so forth are calculated on raster surfaces such as DEMs \\n(digital elevation models; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File \\nFormats\"). In addition, surface analysis techniques can also be applied to more esoteric mapping \\nefforts such as probability of tornados or concentration of infant mortalities in a given region. In this \\nsection we discuss a few methods for creating surfaces and common surface analysis techniques \\nrelated to terrain datasets. \\nSeveral common raster-based neighborhood analyses provide valuable insights into the surface \\nproperties of terrain. Slope maps (part (a) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") are excellent for analyzing and visualizing landform characteristics and are \\nfrequently used in conjunction with aspect maps (defined later) to assess watershed units, inventory \\nforest resources, determine habitat suitability, estimate slope erosion potential, and so forth. They \\nare typically created by fitting a planar surface to a 3-by-3 moving window around each target cell. \\nWhen dividing the horizontal distance across the moving window (which is determined via the \\nspatial resolution of the raster image) by the vertical distance within the window (measure as the \\ndifference between the largest cell value and the central cell value), the slope is relatively easily \\nobtained. The output raster of slope values can be calculated as either percent slope or degree of \\nslope. \\nAny cell that exhibits a slope must, by definition, be oriented in a known direction. This orientation \\nis referred to as aspect. Aspect maps (part (b) ofFigure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") use slope information to produce output raster images whereby the value of each \\ncell denotes the direction it faces. This is usually coded as either one of the eight ordinal directions \\n(north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) or in degrees from 1\u00b0 (nearly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  206 \\ndue north) to 360\u00b0 (back to due north). Flat surfaces have no aspect and are given a value of \u22121. To \\ncalculate aspect, a 3-by-3 moving window is used to find the highest and lowest elevations around \\nthe target cell. If the highest cell value is located at the top-left of the window (\u201ctop\u201d being due north) \\nand the lowest value is at the bottom-right, it can be assumed that the aspect is southeast. The \\ncombination of slope and aspect information is of great value to researchers such as botanists and \\nsoil scientists because sunlight availability varies widely between north-facing and south-facing \\nslopes. Indeed, the various light and moisture regimes resulting from aspect changes encourage \\nvegetative and edaphic differences. \\nA hillshade map (part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps\") \\nrepresents the illumination of a surface from some hypothetical, user-defined light source \\n(presumably, the sun). Indeed, the slope of a hill is relatively brightly lit when facing the sun and \\ndark when facing away. Using the surface slope, aspect, angle of incoming light, and solar altitude as \\ninputs, the hillshade process codes each cell in the output raster with an 8-bit value (0\u2013255) \\nincreasing from black to white. As you can see in part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c \\nand d) Hillshade Maps\", hillshade representations are an effective way to visualize the three-\\ndimensional nature of land elevations on a two-dimensional monitor or paper map. Hillshade maps \\ncan also be used effectively as a baseline map when overlain with a semitransparent layer, such as a \\nfalse-color digital elevation model (DEM; part (d) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  207 \\nFigure 8.12 (a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nViewshed analysis is a valuable visualization technique that uses the elevation value of cells in a DEM \\nor TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) to determine those areas that can be seen from one or more \\nspecific location(s) (part (a) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed Maps\"). The viewing \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  208 \\nlocation can be either a point or line layer and can be placed at any desired elevation. The output of \\nthe viewshed analysis is a binary raster that classifies cells as either 1 (visible) or 0 (not visible). In \\nthe case of two viewing locations, the output raster values would be 2 (visible from both points), 1 \\n(visible from one point), or 0 (not visible from either point). \\nAdditional parameters influencing the resultant viewshed map are the viewing azimuth (horizontal \\nand/or vertical) and viewing radius. The horizontal viewing azimuth is the horizontal angle of the \\nview area and is set to a default value of 360\u00b0. The user may want to change this value to 90\u00b0 if, for \\nexample, the desired viewshed included only the area that could be seen from an office window. \\nSimilarly, vertical viewing angle can be set from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. Finally, the viewing radius determines \\nthe distance from the viewing location that is to be included in the output. This parameter is \\nnormally set to infinity (functionally, this includes all areas within the DEM or TIN under \\nexamination). It may be decreased if, for instance, you only wanted to include the area within the 100 \\nkm broadcast range of a radio station. \\nSimilarly, watershed analyses are a series of surface analysis techniques that define the topographic \\ndivides that drain surface water for stream networks (part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) \\nWatershed Maps\"). In geographic information systems (GISs), a watershed analysis is based on input \\nof a \u201cfilled\u201d DEM. A filled DEM is one that contains no internal depressions (such as would be seen \\nin a pothole, sink wetland, or quarry). From these inputs, a flow direction raster is created to model \\nthe direction of water movement across the surface. From the flow direction information, a flow \\naccumulation raster calculates the number of cells that contribute flow to each cell. Generally \\nspeaking, cells with a high value of flow accumulation represent stream channels, while cells with \\nlow flow accumulation represent uplands. With this in mind, a network of rasterized stream \\nsegments is created. These stream networks are based on some user-defined minimum threshold of \\nflow accumulation. For example, it may be decided that a cell needs at least one thousand \\ncontributing cells to be considered a stream segment. Altering this threshold value will change the \\ndensity of the stream network. Following the creation of the stream network, a stream link raster is \\ncalculated whereby each stream segment (line) is topologically connected to stream intersections \\n(nodes). Finally, the flow direction and stream link raster datasets are combined to determine the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  209 \\noutput watershed raster as seen in part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed \\nMaps\" (Chang 2008). [1] Such analyses are invaluable for watershed management and hydrologic \\nmodeling. \\nFigure 8.13 (a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed Maps \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n\u2022 Nearest neighborhood functions are frequently used to on raster surfaces to create slope, aspect, \\nhillshade, viewshed, and watershed maps. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

This chapter is concerned less with the \\ncomputational options available to the GIS user and more with the artistic options. In essence, this \\nchapter shifts the focus away from GIS tools and toward cartographic tools, although the two are \\nbecoming more and more inextricably bound. Unfortunately, many GIS users are never exposed to \\nthe field of cartography. In these cases, the hard work of creating, maintaining, aligning, and \\nanalyzing complex spatial datasets are not truly appreciated as the final mapping product may not \\nadequately communicate this information to the consumer. In addition, maps, like statistics, can be \\nused to distort information, as illustrated by Mark Monmonier\u2019s (1996) [1] book titled How to Lie with \\nMaps. Indeed, a strong working knowledge of cartographic rules will not only assist in the avoidance \\nof potential misrepresentation of spatial information but also enhance one\u2019s ability to identify these \\nindiscretions in other cartographers\u2019 creations. The cartographic principles discussed herein are laid \\nout to guide GIS users through the process of transforming accumulated bits of GIS data into \\nattractive, useful maps for print and display. This discussion specifically addresses the intricacies of \\neffective color usage (Section 9.1 \"Color\"), symbol selection (Section 9.2 \"Symbology\"), and map \\nlayout and design (Section 9.3 \"Cartographic Design\"). \\n \\n[1] Monmonier, M. 1996.

The objective of this section is to gain an understanding the properties of color and how best to utilize \\nthem in your cartographic products. \\nAlthough a high-quality map is composed of many different elements, color is one of the first \\ncomponents noticed by end-users. This is partially due to the fact that we each have an intuitive \\nunderstanding of how colors are, and should be, used to create an effective and pleasing visual \\nexperience. Nevertheless, it is not always clear to the map-maker which colors should be used to best \\nconvey the purpose of the product. This intuition is much like listening to our favorite music. We \\nknow when a note is in tune or out of tune, but we wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any idea of how to fix a \\nbad note. Color is indeed a tricky piece of the cartographic puzzle and is not surprisingly the most \\nfrequently criticized variable on computer-generated maps (Monmonier 1996). [1] This section \\nattempts to outline the basic components of color and the guidelines to most effectively employ this \\nimportant map attribute. \\nColor Basics \\nAs electromagnetic radiation (ER) travels via waves from the sun (or a lightbulb) to objects on the earth, \\nportions of the ER spectrum are absorbed, scattered, or reflected by various objects. The resulting \\nproperty of the absorbed, scattered, and reflected ER is termed \u201ccolor.\u201d White is the color resulting from \\nthe full range of the visual spectrum and is therefore considered the benchmark color by which all others \\nare measured. Black is the absence of ER. All other colors result from a partial interaction with the ER \\nspectrum. \\nThe three primary aspects of color that must be addressed in map making are hue, value, and \\nsaturation. Hue is the dominant wavelength or color associated with a reflecting object. Hue is the most \\nbasic component of color and includes red, blue, yellow, purple, and so forth.  Value is the amount of white \\nor black in the color. Value is often synonymous with contrast. Variations in the amount of value for a \\ngiven hue result in varying degrees of lightness or darkness for that color. Lighter colors are said to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  212 \\npossess high value, while dark colors possess low value. Monochrome colors are groups of colors with the \\nsame hue but with incremental variations in value. As seen in , variations in value will typically lead the \\nviewer\u2019s eye from dark areas to light areas. \\nFigure 9.1 Value \\n \\nSaturation describes the intensity of color. Full saturation results in pure colors, while low saturation \\ncolors approach gray. Variations in saturation yield different shades and tints.  Shades are produced by \\nblocking light, such as by an umbrella, tree, curtain, and so forth. Increasing the amount of shading \\nresults in grays and blacks. Tint is the opposite of shade and is produced by adding white to a color. Tints \\nand shades are particularly germane when using additive color models (see for more on additive color \\nmodels). To maximize the interpretability of a map, use saturated colors to represent hierarchically \\nprominent features and washed-out colors to represent background features. \\nIf used properly, color can greatly enhance and support map design. Likewise, color can detract from a \\nmapping product if abused. To use color properly, one must first consider the purpose of the map. In \\nsome cases, the use of color is not warranted. Grayscale maps can be just as effective as color maps if the \\nsubject matter merits it. Regardless, there are many reasons to use color. The five primary reasons are \\noutlined here. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  213 \\nColor is particularly suited to convey meaning (). For example, red is a strong color that evokes a \\npassionate response in humans. Red has been shown to evoke physiological responses such as increasing \\nthe rate of respiration and raising blood pressure. Red is frequently associated with blood , war, violence, \\neven love. On the other hand, blue is a color associated with calming effects. Associated with the sky or \\nocean, blue colors can actually assist in sleep and is therefore a recommended color for bedrooms. Too \\nmuch blue, however, can result in a lapse from calming effects into feelings of depression (i.e., having the \\n\u201cblues\u201d). Green is most commonly associated with life or nature (plants). The color green is certainly one \\nof the most topical colors in today\u2019s society with commonplace references to green construction, the Green \\nparty, going green, and so forth. Green, however, can also represent envy and inexperience (e.g., the \\ngreen-eyed monster, greenhorn). Brown is also a nature color but more as a representation of earth and \\nstone. Brown can also imply dullness. Yellow is most commonly associated with sunshine and warmth, \\nsomewhat similar to red. Yellow can also represent cowardice (e.g., yellow -bellied). Black, the absence of \\ncolor, is possibly the most meaning-laden color in modern parlance. Even more than the others, the color \\nblack purports surprisingly strong positive and negative connotations. Black conveys mystery, elegance, \\nand sophistication (e.g., a black-tie affair, in the black), while also conveying loss, evil, and negativity (e .g., \\nblackout, black-hearted, black cloud, blacklist). \\nFigure 9.2 Use of Color to Provide Meaning \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  214 \\nIn this map, red counties are those that voted for the Republican Party in the 2004 presidential \\nelection, while blue counties voted Democrat. These colors are typically used to designate the \\nDemocratic and Republican Parties. \\nThe second reason to use color is for clarification and emphasis (). Warm colors, such as reds and yellows, \\nare notable for emphasizing spatial features. These colors will often jump of f the page and are usually the \\nfirst to attract the reader\u2019s eye, particularly if they are counterbalanced with cool colors, such as blues and \\ngreens (see for more on warm and cool colors). In addition, the use of a hue with high saturation will \\nstand out starkly against similar hues of low saturation. \\nFigure 9.3 Use of Color to Provide Emphasis \\n \\nRed marks the spot! \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  215 \\nColor use is also important for creating a map with pleasing aesthetics (). Certainly, one of the most \\nchallenging aspects of map creation is developing an effective color palette. When looking at maps \\nthrough an aesthetic lens, we are truly starting to think of our creations as artwork. Although somewhat \\nparticular to individual viewers, we all have an innate understanding of when colors in a g raphic/art are \\naesthetically pleasing and when they are not. For example, color use is considered harmonious when \\ncolors from opposite sides of the color wheel are used (), whereas equitable use of several major hues can \\ncreate an unbalanced image. \\nFigure 9.4 Use of Color to Provide Aesthetics \\n \\nThe fourth use of color is abstraction (). Color abstraction is an effective way to illustrate quantitative and \\nqualitative data, particularly for thematic products such as choropleth maps. Here, colors are used sol ely \\nto denote different values for a variable and may not have any particular rhyme or reason.  shows a typical \\nthematic map with abstract colors representing different countries.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  216 \\nFigure 9.5 Use of Color to Provide Abstraction \\n \\nOpposite abstraction, color can also be used to represent reality (). Maps showing elevation (e.g., digital \\nelevation models or DEMs) are often given false colors that approximate reality. Low areas are colored in \\nvariations of green to show areas of lush vegetation growth. Mid-elevations (or low-lying desert areas) are \\ncolored brown to show sparse vegetation growth. Mountain ridges and peaks are colored white to show \\naccumulated snowfall. Watercourses and water bodies are colored blue. Unless there is a specific reason \\nnot to, natural phenomena represented on maps should always be colored to approximate their actual \\ncolor to increase interpretability and to decrease confusion. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  217 \\nFigure 9.6 \\n3\\n \\nGreens, blues, and browns are used to imitate real-world phenomena. \\nColor Models \\nColor models are systems that allow for the creation of a range of colors from a short list of primary \\ncolors. Color models can be additive or subtractive. Additive color models combine emitted light to \\ndisplay color variations and are commonly used with computer monitors, televisions, scanners, digital \\ncameras, and video projectors. The RGB (red-green-blue) color model is the most common additive model \\n(part (a) of ). The RGB model combines light beams of the primary hues of red, green, and blue to yield \\nadditive secondary hues of magenta, cyan, and yellow. Although there is a substantive difference between \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  218 \\npure yellow light (~580 nm) and a mixture of green and red light, the human eye perceives these signals \\nas the same. The RGB model typically employs three 8-bit numeric values (called an RGB triplet) ranging \\nfrom 0 to 255 to model colors. For instance, the RGB triplets for the pure primary and secondary colors \\nare as follows: \\n\u2022 Red = (255, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 Green = (0, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Blue = (0, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Magenta = (255, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Cyan = (0, 255, 255) \\n\u2022 Yellow = (255, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Black, the absence of additive color = (0, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 White, the sum of all additive color = (255, 255, 255) \\nTwo other common additive color models, based on the RGB model, are the HSL  (hue, saturation, \\nlightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, value) models (, b and c). These models are based on cylindrical \\ncoordinate systems whereby the angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to the hue; the \\ndistance from the central axis corresponds to saturation; and the distance along the central axis \\ncorresponds to either saturation or lightness. Because of their basis in the RGB model, both the HSL and \\nHSV color models can be directly transformed between the three additive models. While these relatively \\nsimple additive models provide minimal computer-processing time, they do possess the disadvantage of \\nglossing over some of the complexities of color. For example, the RGB color model does not define \\n\u201cabsolute\u201d color spaces, which connotes that these hues may look differently when viewed on different \\ndisplays. Also, the RGB hues are not evenly spaced along the color spectrum, meaning combinations of \\nthe hues is less than exact. \\nFigure 9.7 Additive Color Models: (a) RGB, (b) HSL, and (c) HSV \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  219 \\nIn contrast to an additive model, subtractive color models involve the mixing of paints, dyes, or inks to \\ncreate full color ranges. These subtractive models display color on the assumption that white, ambient \\nlight is being scattered, absorbed, and reflected from the page by the pri nting inks. Subtractive models \\ntherefore create white by restricting ink from the print surface. As such, these models assume the use of \\nwhite paper as other paper colors will result in skewed hues. CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is the \\nmost common subtractive color model and is occasionally referred to as a \u201cfour-color process\u201d (). \\nAlthough the CMY inks are sufficient to create all of the colors of the subtractive rainbow, a black ink is \\nincluded in this model as it is much cheaper than using a CMY mix for all blacks (black being the most \\ncommonly printed color) and because combining CMY often results in more of a dark brown hue. The \\nCMYK model creates color values by entering percentages for each of the four colors ranging from 0 \\npercent to 100 percent. For example, pure red is composed of 14 percent cyan, 100 percent magenta, 99 \\npercent yellow, and 3 percent black. \\nAs you may guess, additive models are the preferred choice when maps are to be displayed on a computer \\nmonitor, while subtractive models are preferred when printing. If in doubt, it is usually best to use the \\nRGB model as this supports a larger percentage of the visible spectrum in comparison with the CMYK \\nmodel. Once an image is converted from RGB to CMYK, the additional RGB information is irretrievably \\nlost. If possible, collecting both RGB and CMYK versions of an image is ideal, particularly if your graphic \\nis to be both printed and placed online. One last note, you will also want to be selective in your use of file \\nformats for these color models. The JPEG and GIF graphic file formats are the best choice for RGB \\nimages, while the EPS and TIFF graphic file formats are preferred with printed CMYK images.  \\nFigure 9.8 Subtractive Color Model: CMYK \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  220 \\nColor Choices \\nEffective color usage requires a modicum of knowledge about the color wheel. Invented by Sir Isaac \\nNewton in 1706, the color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic \\nrelationships. Primary hues are equidistant from each other with secondary and tertiary colors \\nintervening. The red-yellow-blue color wheel is the most frequently used (); however, the magenta -yellow-\\ncyan wheel is the preferred choice of print makers (for reasons described in the previous section). Primary \\ncolors are those that cannot be created by mixing other colors; secondary colors are defined as those \\ncolors created by mixing two primary hues; tertiary colors are those created by mixing primary and \\nsecondary hues. Furthermore, complementary colors are those placed opposite each on t he wheel, while \\nanalogous colors are located proximal to each other. Complementary colors emphasize differences. \\nAnalogues suggest harmony. \\nFigure 9.9 Color Wheel Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  221 \\n \\nColors can be further referred to as warm or cool (). Warm colors are those that might be seen during a \\nbright, sunny day. Cool colors are those associated with overcast days. Warm colors are typified by hues \\nranging from red to yellow, including browns and tans. Cool color hues range from blue -green through \\nblue-violet and include the majority of gray variants. When used in mapping, it is wise to use warm and \\ncool colors with care. Indeed, warm colors stand out, appear active, and stimulate the viewer. Cool colors \\nappear small, recede, and calm the viewer. As you might guess, it is important th at you apply warm colors \\nto the map features of primary interest, while using cool colors on the secondary, background, and/or \\ncontextual features. \\nFigure 9.10 Warm (Orange) and Cool (Blue) Colors \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  222 \\n \\nNote that the warm color stands out, while the cool color recedes. \\nIn light of the plethora of color schemes and options available, it is wise to follow some basic color usage \\nguidelines. For example, changes in hue are best suited to visualizing qualitative data, while changes in \\nvalue and saturation are effective at visualizing quantitative data. Likewise, variations in lightness and \\nsaturation are best suited to representing ordered data since these establish hierarchy among features. In \\nparticular, a monochromatic color scale is an effective way to represent the order of data whereby light \\ncolors represent smaller data values and dark colors represent larger values. Keep in mind that it is best to \\nuse more light shades than dark ones as the human eye can better discern lighter shades. Also, the \\nnumber of coincident colors that can be distinguished by humans is around seven, so be careful not to \\nabuse the color palette in your maps. If the data being mapped has a zero point, a dichromatic scale () \\nprovides a natural breaking point with increasing color values on each end of the scale representing \\nincreasing data values. \\nFigure 9.11 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  223 \\n \\nA dichromatic scale is essentially two monochromatic scales joined by a low color value in the \\ncenter. \\nIn addition, darker colors result in more important or pronounced graphic featu res (assuming the \\nbackground is not overly dark). Use dark colors on features whose visual impact you wish to magnify. \\nFinally, do not use all the colors of the spectrum in a single map. It is best to leave such messy, rainbow -\\nspectacular effects to the late Jackson Pollock and his abstract expressionist ilk. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Colors are defined by their hue, value, saturation, shade, and tint. \\n\u2022 Colors are used to convey meaning, clarification and emphasis, aesthetics, abstraction, and reality.  \\n\u2022 Color models can be additive (e.g., RGB) or subtractive (e.g., CMYK). \\n\u2022 The color wheel is a powerful tool that assists in the selection of colors for your cartographic products.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how to best utilize point, line, and polygon symbols to assist \\nin the interpretation of your map and its features. \\nWhile color is an integral variable when choosing how to best represent spatial data, making \\ninformed decisions on the size, shape, and type of symbols is equally important. Although raster data \\nare restricted to symbolizing features as a single cell or as cell groupings, vector data allows for a vast \\narray of options to symbolize points, lines, and polygons in a map. Like color, cartographers must \\ntake care to use symbols judiciously in order to most effectively communicate the meaning and \\npurpose of the map to the viewer. \\nBasic Symbol Guidelines \\nVector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a myriad of ways. The guidelines laid out in this \\nsection will help you to make informed decisions on how best to represent the features in your map. The \\nprimary visual variables associated with symbolization include size, texture, pattern, and shape ( Figure \\n9.12 \"Visual Variables\"). Changes to symbol size and texture are most effectively used in conjunction with \\nordinal, interval, and ratio data. Changes to symbol pattern and shape are preferred in conjunction with \\nnominal data. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  225 \\nFigure 9.12 Visual Variables \\n \\nVariations in the size of symbols are powerful indicators of feature importance. Intuitively, larger symbols \\nare assumed to be more important than smaller symbols. Although symbol size is most commonly \\nassociated with point features, linear symbols can effectively be altered in size by adjusting line width. \\nPolygon features can also benefit from resizing. Despite the fact that the area of the polygon can\u2019t be \\nchanged, a point representing the centroid of the polygon can be included in the map. These polygon \\ncentroids can be resized and symbolized as desired, just like any other point feature. Varying symbol size \\nis moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is ineffective with nominal data.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  226 \\nSymbol texture, also referred to as spacing, refers to the compactness of the marks that make up the \\nsymbol. Points, lines, and polygons can be filled with horizontal hash marks, for instance. The closer these \\nhash marks are spaced within the feature symbol, the more hierarchically important the feature will \\nappear. Varying symbol texture is most effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is \\nineffective with nominal data. \\nMuch like texture, symbols can be filled with different patterns. These patterns are typically some artistic \\nabstraction that may or may not attempt to visualize real-world phenomena. For example, a land-use map \\nmay change the observed fill patterns of various land types to try to depict the dominant plants associated \\nwith each vegetation community. Changes to symbol patterns are most often associated with polygon \\nfeatures, although there is some limited utility in changing the fill patterns of points and lines. Varying \\nsymbol size is moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data and is ineffective when \\napplied to nominal data. \\nAltering symbol shape can have dramatic effects on the appearance of map features. Point symbols are \\nmost commonly symbolized with circles. Circles tend to be the default point symbol due to their \\nunchanging orientation, compact shape, and viewer preference. Other geometric shapes can also \\nconstitute effective symbols due to their visual stability and conservation of map space. Unless specific \\nconditions allow, volumetric symbols (spheres, cubes, etc.) should be used sparingly as they rarely \\ncontribute more than simple, two-dimensional symbols. In addition to geometric symbols, pictograms are \\nuseful representations of point features and can help to add artistic flair to a map. Pictograms should \\nclearly denote features of interest and should not require interpretation by the viewer ( Figure 9.13 \\n\"Pictograms\"). Locales that frequently employ pictograms include picnic areas, camping sites, road signs, \\nbathrooms, airports, and so forth. Varying symbol shape is most effective when applied to nominal data \\nand is moderately effective with ordinal and nominal data. \\nFinally, applying variations in lightness/darkness will affect the hierarchical value of a symbol. The darker \\nthe symbol, the more it stands out among lighter features. Variations in the lightness/darkness of a \\nsymbol are most effective when applied to ordinal data, are moderately effective when applied to \\nnumerical data, and are ineffective when applied to nominal data.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  227 \\nFigure 9.13 Pictograms \\n \\nKeep in mind that there are many other visual variables that can be employed in a map, depending on the \\ncartographic software used. Regardless of the chosen symbology, it is important to maintain a logical \\nrelationship between the symbol and the data. Also, visual contrast between different mapped variables \\nmust be preserved. Indeed, the efficacy of your map will be greatly diminished if you do not ensure that its \\nsymbols are readily identifiable and look markedly different from each other.  \\nProportional Symbolization \\nIn addition to the uniform symbols presented in the previous section, symbols for a single, q uantitative \\nvariable can be sized proportionally to match the data values. These proportional symbols are useful for \\npresenting a fairly exact understanding of the differences in magnitude within a dataset. As the numeric \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  228 \\nvalues for each class increases, so too does the size of the symbol representing that class. This allows the \\nsymbol size of features to be directly related to the attribute values they represent whereby small points \\ndenote small data values and large points denote large data values.  \\nSimilar to proportional symbols, range graded symbols group raw data into classes with each class \\nrepresented by a differently sized symbol. Both proportional and range graded symbols are most \\nfrequently used with point data, but lines and polygons can benefit from proportional symbolization as \\nwell. In the case of linear datasets, line width is most frequently used as the proportional visual variable. \\nPolygon datasets typically summarize a quantitative variable within each polygon, place a centroid within \\nthat polygon, and proportion that centroid point symbol. Range grading should not be used if the data \\nrange for a given variable is small. In these cases, range grading will suggest larger differences in the data \\nvalues than is merited. \\nThe advantage of proportional symbolization is the ease with which the viewer can discriminate symbol \\nsize and thus understand variations in the data values over a given map extent. On the other hand, \\nviewers may misjudge the magnitude of the proportional symbols if they do not pa y close attention to the \\nlegend. In addition, the human eye does not see and interpret symbol size in absolute terms. When \\nproportional circles are used in maps, it is typical that the viewer will underestimate the larger circles \\nrelative to the smaller circles. To address this potential pitfall, graduated symbols can be based on either \\nmathematical or perceptual scaling. Mathematical scaling directly relates symbol size with the data value \\nfor that locale. If one value is twice as large as another, it will be represented with a symbol twice as large \\nas the other. Perceptual scaling overcomes the underestimation of large symbols by making these symbols \\nmuch larger than their actual value would indicate (Figure 9.14 \"Mathematical versus Perceptual \\nScaling\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  229 \\nFigure 9.14 Mathematical versus Perceptual Scaling \\n \\nA disadvantage of proportional symbolization is that the symbol size can appear variable depending on \\nthe surrounding symbols. This is best shown via the Ebbinghaus illusion (also known as Titchener \\ncircles). As you can see in Figure 9.15 \"Ebbinghaus Illusion\", the central circles are both the same size but \\nappear different due to the visual influence of the surrounding circles. If you are creating a graphic with \\nmany different symbols, this illusion can wreak havoc on the interpretability of your map.  \\nFigure 9.15 Ebbinghaus Illusion \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  230 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a variety of ways.

The objective of this section is to familiarize cartographers with the basic cartographic principles that \\ncontribute to effective map design. \\nIn addition to effective use of colors and symbols, a map that is well designed will greatly enhance its \\nability to relate pertinent spatial information to the viewer. Judicious use of map elements, \\ntypography/labels, and design principles will result in maps that minimize confusion and maximize \\ninterpretability. Furthermore, the use of these components must be guided by a keen understanding \\nof the map\u2019s purpose, intended audience, topic, scale, and production/reproduction method. \\nMap Elements \\nChapter 9 \"Cartographic Principles\", Section 9.1 \"Color\" and Section 9.2 \"Symbology\" discussed visual \\nvariables specific to the spatial features of a map. However, a map is composed of many more elements \\nthan just the spatial features, each of which contributes immensely to the interpretability and flow of the \\noverall map. This section outlines the basic map elements that should be incorporated into a \u201ccomplete\u201d \\nmap. Following Slocum et al. (2005), [1] these elements are listed in the logical order in which they should \\nbe placed into the map (Figure 9.16 \"A US Map Showing Various Map Elements\"). \\nThe first feature that should be placed into the map layout is the frame line. This line is essentially a \\nbordering box that surrounds all the map elements described hereafter. All of these map elements should \\nbe balanced within the frame line. To balance a map, ensure that neither large blank spaces nor jumbled \\nmasses of information are present within the map. Similar to frame lines are  neat lines. Neat lines are \\nborder boxes that are placed around individual map elements. By definition, neat lines must occu r within \\nthe frame line. Both frame lines and neat lines are typically thin, black -lined boxes, but they can be altered \\nto match the specific aesthetics of an individual map. \\nThe mapped area is the primary geographic component of the overall map. The mapped area contains all \\nof the features and symbols used to represent the spatial phenomena being displayed. The mapped area is \\ntypically bordered with a neat line. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  232 \\nInsets can be thought of as secondary map areas, each encased within their own neat line. These  neat lines \\nshould be of different thickness or type than other line features on the map to adequately demarcate them \\nfrom other map features. Insets often display the primary mapped area in relation to a larger area. For \\nexample, if the primary map shows the locales of national parks with a county, an inset displaying the \\nlocation of that county within the larger state boundary may be included. Conversely, insets are also used \\nto display areas related to the primary map but that occur at some far off local e. This type of inset is often \\nused with maps of the United States whereby Alaska and Hawaii are placed as insets to a map of the \\ncontiguous United States. Finally, insets can be used to clarify areas where features would otherwise be \\novercrowded if restricted to the primary mapping area. If the county map of national parks contained four \\nsmall, adjacent parks, an inset could be used to expand that jumbled portion of the map to show the exact \\nspatial extent of each of the four parks. This type of inset is frequently seen when showing the small \\nnortheastern states on a map of the entire United States. \\nAll maps should have a title. The title is one of the first map elements to catch the viewer\u2019s eye, so care \\nshould be taken to most effectively represent the intent of the map with this leading text. The title should \\nclearly and concisely explain the purpose of the map and should specifically target the intended viewing \\naudience. When overly verbose or cryptically abbreviated, a poor title will detract immensely from the \\ninterpretability of the cartographic end-product. The title should contain the largest type on the map and \\nbe limited to one line, if possible. It should be placed at the top-center of the map unless there is a specific \\nreason otherwise. An alternate locale for the title is directly above the legend. \\nThe legend provides a self-explanatory definition for all symbols used within the mapped area. Care must \\nbe taken when developing this map element, as a multitude of features within a dataset can lead to an \\noverly complex legend. Although placement of the legend is variable, it should be placed within the white \\nspace of the map and not in such a way that it masks any other map elements. Atop the legend box is the \\noptional legend header. The legend header should not simply repeat the information from the title, nor \\nshould it include extraneous, non-legend-specific information. The symbols representing mapped features \\nshould be to the left of the explanatory text. Placing a neat line around the legend will help to bring \\nattention to the element and is recommended but not required. Be careful not to take up too much of the \\nmap with the legend, while also not making the legend so small that it becomes difficult to read or that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  233 \\nsymbols become cluttered. Removing information related to base map features (e.g., state boundaries on a \\nUS map) or readily identifiable features (e.g., highway or interstate symbols) is one effective way to \\nminimize legend size. If a large legend is unavoidable, it is acceptable to plac e this feature outside of the \\nmap\u2019s frame line. \\nAttribution of the data source within the map allows users to assess from where the data are derived. \\nStylistically, the data source attribution should be hierarchically minimized by using a relatively small,  \\nsimple font. It is also helpful to preface this map element with \u201cSource:\u201d to avoid confusion with other \\ntypographic elements. \\nAn indicator of scale is invaluable to provide viewers with the means to properly adjudicate the \\ndimensions of the map. While not as important when mapping large or widely familiar locales such as a \\ncountry or continent, the scale element allows viewers to measure distances on the map. The three \\nprimary representations of scale are the representational fraction, verbal scale, and b ar scale (for more, \\nsee Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.1 \"Maps and Map Types\"). The scale indicator should not be \\nprominently displayed within the map as this element is of secondary importance.  \\nFinally, map orientation notifies the viewer of the direction of the map. To assist in clarifying orientation, \\na graticule can also be included in the mapped area. Most maps are made such that the top of the page \\npoints to the north (i.e., a north-up map). If your map is not north-up, there should be a good reason for \\nit. Orientation is most often indicated with a north arrow, of which there are many stylistic options \\navailable in current geographic information system (GIS) software packages. One of the most commonly \\nencountered map errors is the use of an overly large or overly ornate north arrow. North arrows should be \\nfairly inconspicuous as they only need to be viewed once by the reader. Ornate north arrows can be used \\non small scale maps, but simple north arrows are preferred on medium to large- scale maps so as to not \\ndetract from the presumably more important information appearing elsewhere.  \\nTaken together, these map elements should work together to achieve the goal of a clear, ordered, \\nbalanced, and unified map product. Since modern GIS packages allow users to add and remove these \\ngraphic elements with little effort, care must be taken to avoid the inclination to employ these Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  234 \\ncomponents with as little forethought as it takes to create them. The following sections provide further \\nguidance on composing these elements on the page to honor and balance the mapped area.  \\nFigure 9.16 A US Map Showing Various Map Elements \\n \\nTypography and Label Placement \\nType is found throughout all the elements of a map. Type is similar to map symbols in many senses. \\nColoring effects alter typographic hierarchy as lighter type fades into the background and dark type jumps \\nto the fore. Using all uppercase letters and/or bolded letters will result in more pronounced textual \\neffects. Larger font sizes increase the hierarchical weight of the type, so ensure that the size of the type \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  235 \\ncorresponds with the importance of the map feature. Use decorative fonts, bold, and italics sparingly. \\nThese fonts, as well as overly small fonts, can be difficult to read if overused. Most importantly, always \\nspell check your final cartographic product. After spell checking, spell check again. Yu wont reegrett teh \\necstra efort. \\nOther typographic options for altering text include the use of serif, sans serif, and display fonts. While the \\nuse of serif fonts are preferred in written documents to provide horizontal guidelines, either is acceptable \\nin a mapping application (Slocum 2005). [2] Sans serif fonts, on the other hand, are preferred for maps \\nthat are viewed over the Internet. \\nKerning is an effective typographic effect that alters the space between adjacent letters in a word. \\nDecreasing the kerning of a typeset is useful if the text is too large for the space given. Alternatively, \\nincreasing the kerning is an effective way to label large map areas, par ticularly in conjunction with all-\\nuppercase lettering. Like kerning, changes in leading (pronounced \u201cled-ing\u201d) alter the vertical distance \\nbetween lines of text. Leading should not be so cramped that lines of text begin to overwrite each other, \\nnor should it be so wide that lines of text appear unrelated. Other common typographic effects include \\nmasks, callouts, shadows, and halos (Figure 9.17 \"Typographic Effects\"). All of these effects serve to \\nincrease the visibility and importance of the text to which they are applied.  \\nFigure 9.17 Typographic Effects \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  236 \\nIn addition to the general typographic guidelines discussed earlier, there are specific typographic \\nsuggestions for feature labels. Obviously, labels must be placed proximal to their symbols so they are \\ndirectly and readily associated with the features they describe. Labels should maintain a consistent \\norientation throughout so the reader does not have to rubberneck about to read various entries. Also, \\navoid overprinting labels on top of other graphics or typographic features. If that is not possible, consider \\nusing a halo, mask, callout, or shadow to help the text stand out from the background. In the case of maps \\nwith many symbols, be sure that no features intervene between a symbol and its label.  \\nSome typographic guidelines are specific to labels for point, line, and polygon features. Point labels, for \\nexample, should not employ exaggerated kerning or leading. If leader lines are used, they should not \\ntouch the point symbol nor should they include arrow heads. Leader lines should always be represented \\nwith consistent color and line thickness throughout the map extent. Lastly, point labels should be placed \\nwithin the larger polygon in which they reside. For example, if the cities of Illinois were being map ped as \\npoints atop a state polygon layer, the label for the Chicago point symbol should occur entirely over land, \\nand not reach into Lake Michigan. As this feature is located entirely on land, so should its label.  \\nLine labels should be placed above their associated features but should not touch them. If the linear \\nfeature is complex and meandering, the label should follow the general trend of the feature and not \\nattempt to match the alignment of each twist and turn. If the linear feature is particularly lon g, the feature \\ncan be labeled multiple times across its length. Line labels should always read from left to right.  \\nPolygon labels should be placed within the center of the feature whenever possible. If increased emphasis \\nis desired, all-uppercase letters can be effective. If all-uppercase letters are used, exaggerated kerning and \\nleading is also appropriate to increase the hierarchical importance of the feature. If the polygon feature is \\ntoo small to include text, label the feature as if it were a point symbol. Unlike point labels, however, leader \\nlines should just enter into the feature. \\nMap Design Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  237 \\nMap design is a complex process that provides many variables and choices to the cartographer. The \\nBritish Cartographic Society Design Group presented five \u201cPrinciples of Cartographic Design\u201d on their \\nlistserv on November 26, 1999. These principles, and a brief summary of each, are as follows:  \\n1. Concept before compilation. A basic understanding of the concept and purpose of the map \\nmust be secured before the actual mapping exercise begins. Furthermore, there is no way to \\ndetermine what information to include in a map without having first determined who the end-\\nuser is and in what manner the map will be used. A map without a purpose is of no use to anyone.  \\n2. Hierarchy with harmony. Important map features must appear prominent on the map. The \\nless important features should fade into the background. Creating harmony between the primary \\nand secondary representations on the map will lead to a quality product that will best su it the \\nneeds for which it was developed. \\n3. Simplicity from sacrifice. Upon creating a map, it is tempting to add as much information \\ninto the graphic view as can possibly fit. In reality, it is best to leave some stones unturned. Just as \\nthe key to good communication is brevity, it can be said that the key to good mapping is \\nsimplicity. A map can be considered complete when no other features can be removed. Less, in \\nthis instance, is more. \\n4. Maximum information at minimum cost. The purpose of a map is to convey the greatest \\namount of information with the least amount of interpretive effort by the user. Map design should \\nallow complex spatial relationships to be understood at a glance. \\n5. Engage the emotion to engage the understanding. Well-constructed maps are basically \\nworks of art. All of the artistic and aesthetic rules outlined in this chapter serve to engage the \\nemotive center of the viewer. If the viewer does not formulate some basic, emotional response to \\nthe map, the message will be lost. \\nIt should become increasingly clear that the cartographic choices made during the mapping process have \\nas much influence on the interpretation of a map as does the data being mapped. Borrowing liberally from \\nthe popularized Mark Twain quote, it could be said that, \u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, \\nand maps.\u201d Mapmakers, indeed, have the ability to use (or misuse) cartographic principles to represent \\n(or misrepresent) the spatial data at their disposal. It is now up to you, the cartographer, to master the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  238 \\ntools presented in this book to harness the power of maps to elucidate and address the spatial issues with \\nwhich you are confronted. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Commonly used map elements include the neat line, frame line, mapped area, inset, title, legend, data \\nsource, scale, and orientation. \\n\u2022 Like symbology, typography and labeling choices have a major impact on the interpretability of your map.  \\n\u2022 Map design is essentially an artistic endeavor based around a handful of cartographic principles. \\nKnowledge of these principles will allow you create maps worth viewing. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

GIS users typically start their careers performing low-end tasks such as digitizing vast \\nanalogue datasets or error checking voluminous metadata files. However, adept cartographers will \\nsoon find themselves promoted through the ranks and possibly into management positions. Here, \\nthey will be tasked with an assortment of business-related activities such as overseeing work groups, \\ninterfacing with clients, creating budgets, and managing workflows. As GISs become increasingly \\ncommon in today\u2019s business world, so too must cartographers become adept at managing GIS \\nprojects to maximize effective work strategies and minimize waste. Similarly, as GIS projects begin to \\ntake on more complex and ambitious goals, GIS project managers will only become more important \\nand integral to address the upcoming challenges of the job at hand. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  240 \\n10.1 Project Management Basics \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to achieve a basic understanding of the role of a project manager in the \\nlifecycle of a GIS project. \\nProject management is a fairly recent professional endeavor that is growing rapidly to keep pace with \\nthe increasingly complex job market. Some readers may equate management with the posting of \\nclich\u00e9d artwork that lines the walls of corporate headquarters across the nation (Figure 10.1). These \\nposters often depict a multitude of parachuters falling arm-in-arm while forming some odd \\ngeometric shape, under which the poster is titled \u201cTeamwork.\u201d Another is a beautiful photo of a \\nlandscape titled, \u201cMotivation.\u201d Clearly, any job that is easy enough that its workers can be motivated \\nby a pretty picture is a job that will either soon be done by computers or shipped overseas. In reality, \\nproper project management is a complex task that requires a broad knowledge base and a variety of \\nskills. \\nFigure 10.1 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  241 \\nManagement is more than posting vapid, buzzword-laden artwork such as this in the office \\nplace. \\nThe Project Management Institute (PMI) Standards Committee describes project management as \\n\u201cthe application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet or \\nexceed stakeholder needs and expectations.\u201d To assist in the understanding and implementation of \\nproject management, PMI has written a book devoted to this subject titled, \u201cA Guide to the Project \\nManagement Body of Knowledge,\u201d also known as the PMBOK Guide (PMI 2008). This section guides \\nthe reader through the basic tenets of this text. \\nThe primary stakeholders in a given project include the project manager, project team, sponsor/client, \\nand customer/end-user. As project manager, you will be required to identify and solve potential \\nproblems, issues, and questions as they arise. Although much of this section is applicable to the \\nmajority of information technology (IT) projects, GIS projects are particularly challenging due to the \\nlarge storage, integration, and performance requirements associated with this particular field. GIS \\nprojects, therefore, tend to have elevated levels of risk compared to standard IT projects. \\nProject management is an integrative effort whereby all of the project\u2019s pieces must be aligned \\nproperly for timely completion of the work. Failure anywhere along the project timeline will result in \\ndelay, or outright failure, of the project goals. To accomplish this daunting task, \\nfive process groups and nine project management knowledge areas have been developed to meet \\nproject objectives. These process groups and knowledge areas are described in this section. \\nPMBOK Process Groups \\nThe five project management process groups presented here are described separately, but realize that \\nthere is typically a large degree of overlap among each of them.  \\nInitiation, the first process group, defines and authorizes a particular project o r project phase. This is the \\npoint at which the scope, available resources, deliverables, schedule, and goals are decided. Initiation is \\ntypically out of the hands of the project management team and, as such, requires a high -level \\nsponsor/client to approve a given course of action. This approval comes to the project manager in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  242 \\nform of a project charter that provides the authority to utilize organizational resources to address the \\nissues at hand. \\nThe planning process group determines how a newly initiated project phase will be carried out. It focuses \\non defining the project scope, gathering information, reviewing available resources, identifying and \\nanalyzing potential risks, developing a management plan, and estimating timetables and costs. As such, \\nall stakeholders should be involved in the planning process group to ensure comprehensive feedback. The \\nplanning process is also iterative, meaning that each planning step may positively or negatively affect \\nprevious decisions. If changes need to be made during these iterations, the project manager must revisit \\nthe plan components and update those now-obsolete activities. This iterative methodology is referred to \\nas \u201crolling wave planning.\u201d \\nThe executing process group describes those processes employed to compl ete the work outlined in the \\nplanning process group. Common activities performed during this process group include directing project \\nexecution, acquiring and developing the project team, performing quality assurance, and distributing \\ninformation to the stakeholders. The executing process group, like the planning process group, is often \\niterative due to fluctuations in project specifics (e.g., timelines, productivity, unanticipated risk) and \\ntherefore may require reevaluation throughout the lifecycle of the project. \\nThe monitoring and controlling process group is used to observe the project, identify potential problems, \\nand correct those problems. These processes run concurrently with all of the other process groups and \\ntherefore span the entire project lifecycle. This process group examines all proposed changes to the \\nproject and approves only those that do not alter the overall, stated goals of the project. Some of the \\nspecific activities and actions monitored and controlled by this process group include the  project scope, \\nschedule, cost, output quality, reports, risk, and stakeholder interactions.  \\nFinally, the closing process group essentially terminates all of the actions and activities undertaken during \\nthe four previous process groups. This process group includes handing off all pertinent deliverables to the \\nproper recipients and the formal completion of all contracts with the sponsor/client. This process group is \\nalso important to signal the sponsor/client that no more charges will be made, and they can n ow reassign \\nthe project staff and organizational resources as needed. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  243 \\nPMBOK Project Management Knowledge Areas \\nEach of the five aforementioned process groups is available for use with nine different knowledge areas. \\nThese knowledge areas comprise those subjects that project managers must be familiar with to \\nsuccessfully complete a given project. A brief description of each of these nine knowledge areas is \\nprovided here. \\n1. Project integration management describes the ability of the project manager to \u201cidentify, \\ndefine, combine, unify, and coordinate\u201d the various project activities into a coherent whole \\n(PMBOK 2008). It is understood by senior project managers that there is no single way to \\nsuccessfully complete this task. In reality, each manager must apply their specific skills, \\ntechniques, and knowledge to the job at hand. This knowledge area incorporates all five of the \\nPMBOK process groups. \\n2. Project scope management entails an understanding of not only what work is required to \\ncomplete the project but also what extraneous work should be excluded from project. Defining the \\nscope of a project is usually done via the creation of a scope plan document that is distributed \\namong team members. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n3. Project time management takes into account the fact that all projects are subject to certain \\ntime constraints. These time constraints must be analyzed and an overall pr oject schedule must \\nbe developed based on inputs from all project stakeholders (see Section 10.2.1 \"Scheduling\"  for \\nmore on scheduling). This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n4. Project cost management is focused not only with determining a reasonable budget for each \\nproject task but also with staying within the defined budget. Project cost management is often \\neither very simple or very complex. Particular care needs to be taken to work with th e \\nsponsor/client as they will be funding this effort. Therefore, any changes or augments to the \\nproject costs must be vetted through the sponsor/client prior to initiating those changes. This \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring and controlling process \\ngroups. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  244 \\n5. Project quality management identifies the quality standards of the project and determines \\nhow best to satisfy those standards. It incorporates responsibilities such as quality planning, \\nquality assurance, and quality control. To ensure adequate quality management, the project \\nmanager must evaluate the expectations of the other stakeholders and continually monitor the \\noutput of the various project tasks. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n6. Project human resource management involves the acquisition, development, organization, \\nand oversight of all team members. Managers should attempt to include team members in as \\nmany aspects of the task as possible so they feel loyal to the work and invested in creating the best \\noutput possible. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and \\ncontrolling process groups. \\n7. Project communication management describes those processes required to maintain open \\nlines of communication with the project stakeholders. Included in this knowledge area is the \\ndetermination of who needs to communicate with whom, how communication will be maintained \\n(e-mail, letter reports, phone, etc.), how frequently contacts will be made, what barriers will limit \\ncommunication, and how past communications will be tracked and archived. This knowledge area \\nincorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling process groups.  \\n8. Project risk management identifies and mitigates risk to the project. It is concerned with \\nanalyzing the severity of risk, planning responses, and monitoring those identified risks. Risk \\nanalysis has become a complex undertaking as experienced project managers understand that \u201can \\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d Risk management involves working with all team \\nmembers to evaluate each individual task and to minimize the potential for that risk to manifest \\nitself in the project or deliverable. This knowledge area incorporates the plann ing, as well as the \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n9. Project procurement management, the final knowledge area, outlines the process by which \\nproducts, services, and/or results are acquired from outside the project team. This includes \\nselecting business partners, managing contracts, and closing contracts. These contracts are legal \\ndocuments supported by the force of law. Therefore, the fine print must be read and understood \\nto ensure that no confusion arises between the two parties entering into th e agreement.

It has been estimated that only \\n16 percent of fully implemented information technology projects are completed on time and within budget \\n(The Standish Group International 2000). [1] These failed projects result in an estimated loss of over $81 \\nbillion every year! David Hamil discusses the reasons for these failures in his web feature titled, \u201cYour \\nMission, Should You Choose to Accept It: Project Management Excellence\u201d \\n(http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/features/mesa1). \\nThe first noted cause for project failure is poor planning. Every project must undergo some type of \\nplanning-level feasibility study to determine the purpose of the project and the methodologies employed \\nto complete it. A feasibility study is basically used to determine whether or not a project should be given \\nthe \u201cgreen light.\u201d It outlines the project mission, goals, objectives, scope, and constraints. A project may \\nbe deemed unfeasible for a variety of reasons including an unacceptable level of risk, unclear project \\nrequirements, disagreement among clients regarding project objectives, missing key stakeholders, and \\nunresolved political issues. \\nA second cause for project failure is lack of corporate management support. Inadequate staffing and \\nfunding, as well as weak executive sponsorship on the part of the client, will typically result in a project \\nwith little chance of success. One of the most important steps in managing a project will be to determine \\nwhich member of the client\u2019s team is championing your project. This individual, or group of individuals, \\nmust be kept abreast of all major decisions related to the project. If the client\u2019s project champion loses \\ninterest in or contact with the effort, failure is not far afield. \\nA third common cause of project failure is poor project management. A high -level project manager should \\nhave ample experience, education, and leadership abilities, in addition to being a skilled negotiator, \\ncommunicator, problem solver, planner, and organizer. Despite the fact that managers with this wide -Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  246 \\nranging expertise are both uncommon and expensive to maintain, it only takes a failed project or two for a \\nclient to learn the importance of securing the proper person for the job at hand.  \\nThe final cause of project failure is a lack of client focus and the lack of the end -user participation. The \\nclient must be involved in all stages of the lifecycle of the project. More than on e GIS project has been \\ncompleted and delivered to the client, only to discover that the final product was neither what the client \\nenvisioned nor what the client wanted. Likewise, the end-user, which may or may not be the client, is the \\nmost important participant in the long-term survival of the project. The end-user must participate in all \\nstages of project development. The creation of a wonderful GIS tool will most likely go unused if the end -\\nuser can find a better and/or more cost-efficient solution to their needs elsewhere. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Project managers must employ a wide range of activities and actions to achieve the overall goals of the \\nproject. These actions are broken down into five process groups: initiation, planning, executing, \\nmonitoring and controlling, and closing. \\n\u2022 The activities and actions described in this section are applied to nine management knowledge areas that \\nmanagers must be cognizant of to ensure that all the goals of the project will be met: integration \\nmanagement, scope management, time management, cost management, quality management, human \\nresource management, communication management, risk management, and procurement management.  \\n\u2022 Projects can fail for a variety of reasons. Successful managers will be aware of these potential pitfal ls and \\nwill work to overcome them. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. As a student, you are constantly tasked with completing assignments for your classes. Think of one of \\nyour recent assignments as a project that you, as a project (assignment) manager, completed. Describe \\nhow you utilized a sampling of the project management process groups and knowledge areas to complete \\nthat assigned task. \\n \\n[1] The Standish Group International. 2000. \u201cOur Blog.\u201d http://www.pm2go.com. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  247 \\n10.2 GIS Project Management Tools and Techniques \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review a sampling of the common tools and techniques available to \\ncomplete GIS project management tasks. \\nAs a project manager, you will find that there are many tools and techniques that will assist your \\nefforts. While some of these are packaged in a geographic information system (GIS), many are not. \\nOthers are mere concepts that managers must be mindful of when overseeing large projects with a \\nmultitude of tasks, team members, clients, and end-users. This section outlines a sampling of these \\ntools and techniques, although their implementation is dependent on the individual project, scope, \\nand requirements that arise therein. Although these topics could be sprinkled throughout the \\npreceding chapters, they are not concepts whose mastery is typically required of entry-level GIS \\nanalysts or technicians. Rather, they constitute a suite of skills and techniques that are often applied \\nto a project after the basic GIS work has been completed. In this sense, this section is used as a \\nplatform on which to present novice GIS users with a sense of future pathways they may be led down, \\nas well as providing hints to other potential areas of study that will complement their nascent GIS \\nknowledge base. \\nScheduling \\nOne of the most difficult and dread-inducing components of project management for many is the need to \\noversee a large and diverse group of team members. While this text does not cover tips for getting along \\nwith others, ensuring that each project member is on task and up to date is an excellent way to reduce \\npotential problems associated with a complex project. To achieve this, there are several tools available to \\ntrack project schedules and goal completions. \\nThe Gantt chart (named after its creator, Henry Gantt) is a bar chart that is used specifically for tracking \\ntasks throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, Gantt charts show the dependencies of interrelated \\ntasks and focus on the start and completion dates for each specific task. Gantt charts will typically \\nrepresent the estimated task completion time in one color and the actual time to completion in a second Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  248 \\ncolor (Figure 10.2 \"Gantt Chart\"). This color coding allows project members to rapidly assess the project \\nprogress and identify areas of concern in a timely fashion. \\nFigure 10.2 Gantt Chart \\n \\nPERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts are similar to Gantt charts in that they are both \\nused to coordinate task completion for a given project (Figure 10.3 \"PERT Chart\"). PERT charts focus \\nmore on the events of a project than on the start and completion dates as seen with the Gantt charts. This \\nmethodology is more often used with very large projects where adherence to strict time guidelines is more \\nimportant than monetary considerations. PERT charts include the identification of the project\u2019s critical \\npath. After estimating the best- and worst-case scenario regarding the time to finish all tasks, the critical \\npath outlines the sequence of events that results in the longest potential duration for the project. Delays to \\nany of the critical path tasks will result in a net delay to project completion and therefore  must be closely \\nmonitored by the project manager. \\nFigure 10.3 PERT Chart \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  249 \\n \\nThere are some advantages and disadvantages to both the Gantt and PERT chart types. Gantt charts are \\npreferred when working with small, linear projects (with less than thirty or so  tasks, each of which occurs \\nsequentially). Larger projects (1) will not fit onto a single Gantt display, making them more difficult to \\nvisualize, and (2) quickly become too complex for the information therein to be related effectively. Gantt \\ncharts can also be problematic because they require a strong sense of the entire project\u2019s timing before the \\nfirst task has even been committed to the page. Also, Gantt charts don\u2019t take correlations between \\nseparate tasks into account. Finally, any change to the scheduling of the tasks in a Gantt chart results in \\nhaving to recreate the entire schedule, which can be a time-consuming and mind-numbing experience. \\nPERT charts also suffer from some drawbacks. For example, the time to completion for each individual \\ntask is not as clear as it is with the Gantt chart. Also, large project can become very complex and span \\nmultiple pages. Because neither method is perfect, project managers will often use Gantt and PERT charts \\nsimultaneously to incorporate the benefits of each methodology into their project. \\nWorking with CAD Data \\nWhile a GIS commands a large swath of the computer-generated mapping market share, it is not the only \\ncartographic player in town. GIS, as you now hopefully understand, is primarily a database -driven \\nmapping solution. Computer-aided design (CAD), on the other hand, is a graphics-based mapping \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  250 \\nsolution adopted by many cartographers; engineers in particular. Historically speaking, points, lines, and \\npolygons in a CAD system do not link to attributes but are mere drawings representing some reality. CAD \\nsoftware, however, has recently begun to incorporate \u201csmart\u201d features whereby attribute information is \\nexplicitly linked to the spatial representations. \\nCAD is typically used on many projects related to surveying and civil engineering work. For example, \\ncreating a cadastral map for a housing development is a complex matter with a fine scale of exactitude \\nrequired to ensure, for example, that all electrical, sewer, transportation, and gas lines meet at precise \\nlocales (Figure 10.4 \"CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project\"). An error of inches, in \\neither the vertical or horizontal dimension, could result in a need for a major plan redesign that may cost \\nthe client an inordinate amount of time and money. Too many of these types of errors, and you and your \\nengineer may soon be looking for a new job. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  251 \\nFigure 10.4 CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project \\n \\nRegardless, the CAD drawing used to create these development plans is usually only concerned with the \\nlocal information in and around the project site that directly affects the construction of the housing units, \\nsuch as local elevation, soil/substrates, land-use/land-cover types, surface water flows, and groundwater \\nresources. Therefore, local coordinate systems are typically employed by the civil engineer whereby the \\norigin coordinate (the 0, 0 point) is based off of some nearby landmark such as a manhole, fire hydrant, \\nstake, or some other survey control point. While this is acceptable for engineers, the GIS user typically is \\nconcerned not only with local phenomena but also with tying the project into a larger world.  \\nFor example, if a development project impacts a natural watercourse in the state of California, agencies \\nsuch as the US Army Corps of Engineers (a nationwide government agency), California Department of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  252 \\nFish and Game (a statewide government agency), and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (a local \\ngovernment agency) will each exert some regulatory requirements over the d eveloper. These agencies will \\nwant to know where the watercourse originates, where it flows to, where within the length of the \\nwatercourse the development project occurs, and what percentage of the watercourse will be impacted. \\nThese concerns can only be addressed by looking at the project in the larger context of the surrounding \\nwatershed(s) within which the project occurs. To accomplish this, external, standardized GIS datasets \\nmust be brought to bear on the project (e.g., national river reaches, stream f low and rain gauges, habitat \\nmaps, national soil surveys, and regional land-use/land-cover maps). These datasets will normally be \\ngeoreferenced to some global standard and therefore will not automatically overlay with the engineer\u2019s \\nlocal CAD data. \\nAs project manager, it will be your team\u2019s duty to import the CAD data (typically DWG, DGN, or DXF file \\nformat) and align it exactly with the other, georeferenced GIS data layers. While this has not been an easy \\ntask historically, sophisticated tools are being developed by both CAD and GIS software packages to \\nensure that they \u201cplay nicely\u201d with each other. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package contains a \\n\u201cGeoreferencing\u201d toolbar that allows users to shift, pan, resize, rotate, and add control points to assist in \\nthe realignment of CAD data. \\nApplication Development \\nAs project manager, you may discover that the GIS software package employed by your workgroup is \\nmissing some basic functionality that would greatly enhance the productivity of your team. In these cases, \\nit may be worthwhile to create your own GIS application(s). GIS applications are either stand -alone GIS \\nsoftware packages or customizations of a preexisting GIS software package that are made to meet some \\nspecific project need. These applications can range from simple (e.g., apply a standard symbol/color set \\nand text guidelines to mapped features) to complex (e.g., sort layers, select features based on a predefined \\nset of rules, perform a spatial analysis, and output a hard-copy map). \\nSome of the more simple applications can be created by using the canned tool sets and functionality \\nprovided in the GIS software. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package includes a macro language \\ncalled Model Builder that allows users with no knowledge of programming  languages create a series of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  253 \\nautomated tasks, also called workflows, which can be chained together and executed multiple times to \\nreduce the redundancy associated with many types of GIS analyses. The more complex applications will \\nmost likely require the use of the GIS software\u2019s native macro language or to write original code using \\nsome compatible programming language. To return to the example of ESRI products, ArcGIS provides the \\nability to develop and incorporate user-written programs, called scripts, into to standard platform. These \\nscripts can be written in the Python, VBScript, JScript, and Perl programming languages.  \\nWhile you may want to create a GIS application from the ground up to meet your project needs, there are \\nmany that have already been developed. These pre-written applications, many of which are open source, \\nmay be employed by your project team to reduce the time, money, and headache associated with such an \\neffort. A sampling of the open-source GIS applications written for the C-family of programming languages \\nare as follows (Ramsey 2007): [1] \\n1.

Many of them incorporate open -source \\nshared libraries that perform functions such as format support, geoprocessing, and reprojection of \\ncoordinate systems. A sampling of these libraries is as follows: \\n1. GDAL/OGR (http://www.gdal.org)\u2014 \u201cGeospatial Data Abstraction Library/OpenGIS Simple \\nFeatures Reference Implementation\u201d is a compilation of translators for raster and vector \\ngeospatial data formats \\n2.

GEOS (http://geos.refractions.net)\u2014 \u201cGeometry Engine, Open Source\u201d is a compilation of \\nfunctions for processing 2-D linear geometry \\n4. Mapnik (http://www.mapnik.org)\u2014 A tool kit for developing visually appealing maps from \\npreexisting file types (e.g., shapefiles, TIFF, OGR/GDAL) \\n5. FDO (http://fdo.osgeo.org)\u2014 \u201cFeature Data Objects\u201d is similar to, although more complex than, \\nGDAL/OGR in that it provides tools for manipulating, defining, translating, and analyzing \\ngeospatial datasets \\nWhile the C-based applications and libraries noted earlier are common due to their extensive time in \\ndevelopment, newer language families are supported as well. For example, Java has been used to develop \\nunique applications (e.g., gvSIG, OpenMap, uDig, Geoserver, JUMP, and DeeGree) from its l ibraries \\n(GeoAPI, WKB4J, GeoTools, and JTS Topology Suite), while .Net applications (e.g., MapWindow, \\nWorldWind, SharpMap) are a new but powerful application option that support their own libraries \\n(Proj.Net, NTS) as well as the C-based libraries. \\nMap Series \\nA project manager will often be required to produce paper and/or digital maps of the project site. These \\nmaps will typically include standard information such as a title, north arrow, scale bar, corporate contact \\ninformation, data source, and so forth. This is simple if the site is small enough that the pertinent mapped \\nfeatures can be resolved on a single map. However, problems arise if the site is exceedingly large, follows a \\nlinear pathway (e.g., highway improvement projects), or is composed of distant, noncontiguous site Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  255 \\nlocales. In these cases, the manager will need to create a series of easily referenced and reproduced maps \\nthat are at the exact same scale, have minimal overlap, and maintain consistent collar material \\nthroughout. \\nTo accomplish this task, a map series can be employed to create standar dized maps from the GIS (e.g., \\n\u201cDS Map Book\u201d for ArcGIS 9; \u201cData Driven Pages\u201d for ArcGIS 10). A map series is essentially a multipage \\ndocument created by dividing the overall data frame into unique tiles based on a user -\\ndefinedindex grid. Figure 10.5 \"Project Site Tiled into an Output Series\" shows an example of a map series \\nthat divides a project site into a grid of similar tiles. Figure 10.6 \"Output from a Map Series\"  shows the \\nstandardized maps produced when that series is printed. While these maps can certainly be created \\nwithout the use of a map series generator, this functionality greatly assists in the organization and display \\nof project\u2019s whose extents cannot be represented within a single map. \\nFigure 10.5 Project Site Tiled into an Output Series \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  256 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nFigure 10.6 Output from a Map Series \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nGrid-to-Ground Transformations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  257 \\nProject managers must be mindful of the transition from in-program mapped units to real-world \\nlocations. As discussed in Chapter 3 \"Data, Information, and Where to Find Them\", Section 3.2 \"Data \\nabout Data\", transforming the three-dimensional earth to two dimensions necessarily results in both \\naccuracy and precision errors. While projects that cover a small areal extent may not noticeably suffer \\nfrom this error, projects that cover a large areal extent could run into substantial problems. \\nWhen surveyors measure the angles and distances of features on the earth for input into a GIS, they are \\ntaking \u201cground\u201d measurements. However, spatial datasets in a GIS are based on a predefined coordinate \\nsystem, referred to as \u201cgrid\u201d measurements. In the case of angles, ground measurements are taken relative \\nto some north standard such as true north, grid north, or magnetic north. Grid measurements are always \\nrelative to the coordinate system\u2019s grid north. Therefore, grid north and ground north may well need to be \\nrotated in order to align correctly. \\nIn the case of distances, two sources of error may be present: (1) scale error and (2) elevation error. Scale \\nerror refers to the phenomenon whereby points measured on the three-dimensional earth (i.e., ground \\nmeasurement) must first be translated onto the coordinate system\u2019s ellipsoid (i.e., mean sea level), and \\nthen must be translated to the two-dimensional grid plane (Figure 10.7 \"Grid-to-Ground \\nTransformation\"). Basically, scale error is associated with the move from three to two dimensions and is \\nremedied by applying a scale factor (SF) to any measurements made to the dataset.  \\nFigure 10.7 Grid-to-Ground Transformation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  258 \\nIn addition to scale error, elevation error becomes increasingly pronounced as the project site\u2019s elevation \\nbegins to rise. Consider Figure 10.8 \"Grid versus Ground Measurements\", where a line measured as 1,000 \\nfeet at altitude must first be scaled down to fit the earth\u2019s ellipsoid measurement, then scaled again to fit \\nthe coordinate system\u2019s grid plane. Each such transition requires compensation, referred to as the \\nelevation factor (EF). The SF and EF are often combined into a single combination factor (CF) that is \\nautomatically applied to any measurements taken from the GIS. \\nFigure 10.8 Grid versus Ground Measurements \\n \\nIn addition to EF and SF errors, care must be taken when surveying areas greater than 5 miles in length. \\nAt these distances, slight errors will begin to compound and may create noticeable discrepancies. In \\nparticular, projects whose length crosses over coordinate systems zones (e.g., Universal Transverse \\nMercator [UTM] zones or State Plane zones) are likely to suffer from unacceptable grid -to-ground errors. \\nWhile the tools and techniques outlined in this section may be considered beyond the scope of an \\nintroductory text on GISs, these pages represent some of the concerns that will arise during your tenure as \\na GIS project manager. Although you will not need a comprehensive underst anding of these issues for \\nyour first GIS-related jobs, it is important that you understand that becoming a competent GIS user will \\nrequire a wide-ranging skill set, both technically and interpersonally. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  259 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 As project manager, you will need to utilize a wide variety of tools and techniques to complete your GIS \\nproject. \\n\u2022 The tools and techniques you employ will not necessarily be included as a part of your native GIS software \\npackage. In these cases, you will need to apply all project management r esources at your disposal. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. Consider the following GIS project: You are contacted by the City of Miami to determine the effect of \\ninundation due to sea-level rise on municipal properties over the next hundred years. Assuming that the \\nsea level will rise one meter during that time span, describe in detail the process you would take to \\nrespond to this inquiry. Assuming you have two months to complete this task, develop a timeline that \\nshows the steps you would take to respond to the city\u2019s request. In your discussion, include information \\npertaining to the data layers (both raster and vector), data sources, and data attributes needed to address \\nthe problem. Outline some of the geoprocessing steps that would be required to convert your baseline \\nGIS data into project-specific layers that would address this particular problem. Upon completion of the \\ngeospatial analysis, how might you employ cartographic principals to most effectively present the data to \\ncity officials? Talk about potential problems that may arise during the analysis and discuss how you might \\ngo about addressing these issues. \\n \\n[1] Ramsey, P. 2007. \u201cThe State of Open Source GIS.\u201d Refractions \\nResearch.http://www.refractions.net/expertise/whitepapers/opensourcesurvey/survey -open-source-2007-12.pdf. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ']\n"

Moreover, maps \\nof the twenty-first century are not just paper diagrams folded like an accordion. Maps today are \\ncolorful, searchable, interactive, and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and \\ninteractive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of \\ngeographic data. The key technology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the \\ntwenty-first century, is geographic information systems or GIS. \\nPut simply, GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from \\nvarious sources as maps. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of \u201cwhere\u201d has \\ntaken on new meaning. From getting directions to a new restaurant in San Francisco on your mobile \\ndevice to exploring what will happen to coastal cities like Venice if oceans were to rise due to global \\nwarming, GIS provides insights into daily tasks and the big challenges of the future. \\nEssentials of Geographic Information Systems integrates key concepts behind the technology with \\npractical concerns and real-world applications. Recognizing that many potential GIS users are \\nnonspecialists or may only need a few maps, this book is designed to be accessible, pragmatic, and \\nconcise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask \\nquestions, inform choices, and guide policy. From the melting of the polar ice caps to privacy issues \\nassociated with mapping, this book provides a gentle, yet substantive, introduction to the use and \\napplication of digital maps, mapping, and GIS. \\nIn today\\'s world, learning involves knowing how and where to search for information. In some \\nrespects, knowing where to look for answers and information is arguably just as important as the \\nknowledge itself. Because Essentials of Geographic Information Systems is concise, focused, and \\ndirected, readers are encouraged to search for supplementary information and to follow up on \\nspecific topics of interest on their own when necessary. Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems provides the foundations for learning GIS, but readers are encouraged to construct their \\nown individual frameworks of GIS knowledge. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. First, it Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  3 \\npromotes active learning through research. Second, it facilitates flexible and selective learning\u2014 that \\nis, what is learned is a function of individual needs and interest. \\nSince GIS and related geospatial and navigation technology change so rapidly, a flexible and dynamic \\ntext is necessary in order to stay current and relevant. Though essential concepts in GIS tend to \\nremain constant, the situations, applications, and examples of GIS are fluid and dynamic. Though \\nthis book is intended for use in introductory GIS courses, Essentials of Geographic Information \\nSystems will also appeal to the large number of certificate, professional, extension, and online \\nprograms in GIS that are available today. In addition to providing readers with the tools necessary to \\ncarry out spatial analyses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems outlines valuable \\ncartographic guidelines for maximizing the visual impact of your maps. The book also describes \\neffective GIS project management solutions that commonly arise in the modern workplace.

Knowing something about where something happens can \\nhelp us to understand what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and why it happened. \\nWhether it is an outbreak of a highly contagious disease, the discovery of a new frog species, the path of a \\ndeadly tornado, or the nearest location of a supermarket, knowing something about where things happen \\nis important to how we understand and relate to our local environment and to the world at large.  \\nA geographic information system\u2014 or GIS\u2014 is a special type of information technology that can help us \\nunderstand and relate to the \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the world by answering \u201cwhere.\u201d \\nGeographic information systems are indeed about maps, but they are also about much, much more.  \\nA GIS is used to organize, analyze, visualize, and share all kinds of data and information from different \\nhistorical periods and at various scales of analysis. From climatologists trying to understand the causes \\nand consequences of global warming, to epidemiologists locating ground zero of a virulent disease \\noutbreak, to archaeologists reconstructing ancient Rome, to political consultants developing campaign \\nstrategies for the next presidential election, GIS is a very powerful tool.  \\nMore important, GIS is about geography and learning about the world in which we live. As GIS techno logy \\ndevelops, as society becomes ever more geospatially enabled, and as more and more people rediscover \\ngeography and the power of maps, the future uses and applications of GIS are unlimited.  \\nTo take full advantage of the benefits of GIS and related geospatial technology both now and in the future, \\nit is useful to take stock of the ways in which we already think spatially with respect to the world in which \\nwe live. In other words, by recognizing and increasing our geographical awareness about how we relate  to \\nour local environment and the world at large, we will benefit more from our use and application of GIS.  \\nThe purpose of this chapter is to increase our geographical awareness and to refine our spatial thinking. \\nFirst, a simple mental mapping exercise is used to highlight our geographical knowledge and spatial \\nawareness, or lack thereof. Second, fundamental concepts and terms that are central to geographic \\ninformation systems, and more generally geography, are identified, defined, and explained. This chap ter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  5 \\nconcludes with a description of the frameworks that guide the use and application of GIS, as well as its \\nfuture development. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  6 \\n1.1 Spatial Thinking \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to illustrate how we think geographically every day with mental maps and \\nto highlight the importance of asking geographic questions. \\nAt no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to create or to acquire a map of nearly \\nanything. Maps and mapping technology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the modes \\nand means of making and distributing maps have been revolutionized with recent advances in \\ncomputing like the Internet, the art and science of map making date back centuries. This is because \\nhumans are inherently spatial organisms, and in order for us to live in the world, we must first \\nsomehow relate to it. Enter the mental map. \\nMental Maps \\nMental or cognitive maps are psychological tools that we all use every day. As the name \\nsuggests, mental maps are maps of our environment that are stored in our brain. We rely on our mental \\nmaps to get from one place to another, to plan our daily activities, or to understand and situate events that \\nwe hear about from our friends, family, or the news. Mental maps also reflect the amount and ex tent of \\ngeographic knowledge and spatial awareness that we possess. To illustrate this point, pretend that a friend \\nis visiting you from out of town for the first time. Using a blank sheet of paper, take five to ten minutes to \\ndraw a map from memory of your hometown that will help your friend get around. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  7 \\n \\nWhat did you choose to draw on your map? Is your house or where you work on the map? What about \\nstreets, restaurants, malls, museums, or other points of interest? How did you draw objects on your map? \\nDid you use symbols, lines, and shapes? Are places labeled? Why did you choose to include certain places \\nand features on your map but not others? What limitations did you encounter when making your map?  \\nThis simple exercise is instructive for several reasons. First, it illustrates what you know about where you \\nlive. Your simple map is a rough approximation of your local geographic knowledge and mental map. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  8 \\nSecond, it highlights the way in which you relate to your local environment. What you choose to include \\nand exclude on your map provides insights about what places you think are important and how you move \\nthrough your place or residence. Third, if we were to compare your mental map to someone else\u2019s from \\nthe same place, certain similarities emerge that shed light upon how we as humans tend to think spatially \\nand organize geographical information in our minds. Fourth, this exercise reveals something about your \\nartistic, creative, and cartographic abilities. In this respect, not only are mental maps unique, but also the \\nway in which such maps are drawn or represented on the page is unique too.  \\nTo reinforce these points, consider the series of mental maps of Los Angeles provided in Figure 1.1 \\n\"Mental Map of Los Angeles A\". \\nFigure 1.1 Mental Map of Los Angeles A \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  9 \\nFigure 1.2 Mental Map of Los Angeles B \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  10 \\nFigure 1.3 Mental Map of Los Angeles C \\n \\nTake a moment to look at each map and compare the maps with the following questions in mind:  \\n\u2022 What similarities are there on each map? \\n\u2022 What are some of the differences? \\n\u2022 Which places or features are illustrated on the map? \\n\u2022 From what you know about Los Angeles, what is included or excluded on the maps? \\n\u2022 What assumptions are made in each map? \\n\u2022 At what scale is the map drawn? \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  11 \\nEach map is probably an imperfect representation of one\u2019s mental map, but we can see some similarities \\nand differences that provide insights into how people relate to Los Angeles, maps, and more generally, the \\nworld. First, all maps are oriented so that north is up. Though only one of the maps contains a north \\narrow that explicitly informs viewers the geographic orientation of the map, we are accustomed to most \\nmaps having north at the top of the page. Second, all but the first map identify some prominent features \\nand landmarks in the Los Angeles area. For instance, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) appears on \\ntwo of these maps, as do the Santa Monica Mountains. How the airport is represented or portrayed on the \\nmap, for instance, as text, an abbreviation, or symbol, also speaks to our experience using and \\nunderstanding maps. Third, two of the maps depict a portion of the freeway network in Los Angeles, and \\none also highlights the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek. In a city where the \u201ccar is king,\u201d how can any \\nmap omit the freeways? \\nWhat you include and omit on your map, by choice or not, speaks volumes about your geographical \\nknowledge and spatial awareness\u2014 or lack thereof. Recognizing and identifying what we do not know is an \\nimportant part of learning. It is only when we identify the unknown that we  are able to ask questions, \\ncollect information to answer those questions, develop knowledge through answers, and begin to \\nunderstand the world where we live. \\nAsking Geographic Questions \\nFilling in the gaps in our mental maps and, more generally, the gaps in our geographic knowledge requires \\nus to ask questions about the world where we live and how we relate to it. Such questions can be simple \\nwith a local focus (e.g., \u201cWhich way is the nearest hospital?\u201d) or more complex with a more global \\nperspective (e.g., \u201cHow is urbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world?\u201d). The thread \\nthat unifies such questions is geography. For instance, the question of \u201cwhere?\u201d is an essential part of the \\nquestions \u201cWhere is the nearest hospital?\u201d and \u201cWhere are the biodiversity hotspots in relation to cities?\u201d \\nBeing able to articulate questions clearly and to break them into manageable pieces are very valuable \\nskills when using and applying a geographic information system (GIS).  \\nThough there may be no such thing as a \u201cdumb\u201d question, some questions are indeed better than others. \\nLearning how to ask the right question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding the answer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  12 \\nitself. However, when we ask the right question, problems are more easily solved and our understanding \\nof the world is improved. There are five general types of geographic questions that we can ask and that \\nGIS can help us to answer. Each type of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples \\n(Nyerges 1991). [1] \\nQuestions about geographic location: \\n\u2022 Where is it? \\n\u2022 Why is it here or there? \\n\u2022 How much of it is here or there? \\nQuestions about geographic distribution: \\n\u2022 Is it distributed locally or globally? \\n\u2022 Is it spatially clustered or dispersed? \\n\u2022 Where are the boundaries? \\nQuestions about geographic association: \\n\u2022 What else is near it? \\n\u2022 What else occurs with it? \\n\u2022 What is absent in its presence? \\nQuestions about geographic interaction: \\n\u2022 Is it linked to something else? \\n\u2022 What is the nature of this association? \\n\u2022 How much interaction occurs between the locations? \\nQuestions about geographic change: \\n\u2022 Has it always been here? \\n\u2022 How has it changed over time and space? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  13 \\n\u2022 What causes its diffusion or contraction? \\nThese and related geographic questions are frequently asked by people from various areas of  expertise, \\nindustries, and professions. For instance, urban planners, traffic engineers, and demographers may be \\ninterested in understanding the commuting patterns between cities and suburbs (geographic interaction). \\nBiologists and botanists may be curious about why one animal or plant species flourishes in one place and \\nnot another (geographic location/distribution). Epidemiologists and public health officials are certainly \\ninterested in where disease outbreaks occur and how, why, and where they spread (g eographic \\nchange/interaction/location). \\nA GIS can assist in answering all these questions and many more. Furthermore, a GIS often opens up \\nadditional avenues of inquiry when searching for answers to geographic questions. Herein is one of the \\ngreatest strengths of the GIS. While a GIS can be used to answer specific questions or to solve particular \\nproblems, it often unearths even more interesting questions and presents more problems to be solved in \\nthe future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Mental maps are psychological tools that we use to understand, relate to, and navigate through the \\nenvironment in which we live, work, and play. \\n\u2022 Mental maps are unique to the individual. \\n\u2022 Learning how to ask geographic questions is important to using and applying GISs.  \\n\u2022 Geographic questions are concerned with location, distributions, associations, interactions, and change.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Draw a map of where you live. Discuss the similarities, differences, styles, and techniques on your map \\nand compare them with two others. What are the commonalities between the maps? What are the \\ndifferences? What accounts for such similarities and differences?  \\n2. Draw a map of the world and compare it to a world map in an atlas. What similarities and differences are \\nthere? What explains the discrepancies between your map and the atlas? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  14 \\n3. Provide two questions concerned with geographic location, distribution, association, interaction, and \\nchange about global warming, urbanization, biodiversity, economic development, and war.  \\n \\n[1] Nyerges, T. 1991. \u201cAnalytical Map Use.\u201d Cartography and Geographic Information Systems (formerly The \\nAmerican Cartographer) 18: 11\u201322. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  15 \\n1.2 Geographic Concepts \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to introduce and explain how the key concepts of location, direction, \\ndistance, space, and navigation are relevant to geography and geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nBefore we can learn \u201chow to do\u201d a geographic information system (GIS), it is first necessary to review \\nand reconsider a few key geographic concepts that are often taken for granted. For instance, what is a \\nlocation and how can it be defined? At what distance does a location become \u201cnearby\u201d? Or what do \\nwe mean when we say that someone has a \u201cgood sense of direction\u201d? By answering these and related \\nquestions, we establish a framework that will help us to learn and to apply a GIS. This framework \\nwill also permit us to share and communicate geographic information with others, which can \\nfacilitate collaboration, problem solving, and decision making. \\nLocation \\nThe one concept that distinguishes geography from other fields is location, which is central to a \\nGIS. Location is simply a position on the surface of the earth. What is more, nearly everything can be \\nassigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of something, we can a put it on a map, for \\nexample, with a GIS. \\nGenerally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or absolute terms. In the case of the \\nformer, locations are simply defined and described by name. For example, city names such as New York, \\nTokyo, or London refer to nominal locations. Toponymy, or the study of place names and their respective \\nhistory and meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations (Monmonier 1996, 2006).  [1], [2] Though \\nwe tend to associate the notion of location with particular points on the surface of the earth, locations can \\nalso refer to geographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g., Siberia). The United States \\nBoard on Geographic Names (http://geonames.usgs.gov) maintains geographic naming standards and \\nkeeps track of such names through the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS; \\nhttp://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic). The GNIS database also provides information about which \\nstate and county the feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  16 \\nContrasting nominal locations are absolute locations that use some type of reference system to define \\npositions on the earth\u2019s surface. For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth using latitude \\nand longitude is an example of absolute location. Postal codes and street addresses are other examples of \\nabsolute location that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there is no global standard when it \\ncomes to street addresses, we can determine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of \\nparticular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and other geographic data through a pr ocess \\ncalled geocoding. There are several free online geocoders (e.g., http://worldkit.org/geocoder) that return \\nthe latitude and longitude for various locations and addresses around the world.  \\nWith the advent of the global positioning system (GPS) (see alsohttp://www.gps.gov), determining the \\nlocation of nearly any object on the surface of the earth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. \\nGPS technology consists of a constellation of twenty-four satellites that are orbiting the earth and \\nconstantly transmitting time signals (see Figure 1.4 \"Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) \\nSatellites\"). To determine a position, earth-based GPS units (e.g., handheld devices, car navigation \\nsystems, mobile phones) receive the signals from at least three of these satellites and use this information \\nto triangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate system (GCS) to report location. \\nOriginally developed by the United States Department of Defense for military purposes, there are now a \\nwide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  17 \\nFigure 1.4 Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites \\n \\nLocation can also be defined in relative terms. Relative location refers to defining and describing places in \\nrelation to other known locations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg, South Africa; New \\nZealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul, Afghanistan, is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike \\nnominal or absolute locations that define single points, relative locations provide a bit more information \\nand situate one place in relation to another. \\nDirection \\nLike location, the concept of direction is central to geography and GISs. Direction refers to the position of \\nsomething relative to something else usually along a line. In order to determine direction, a reference \\npoint or benchmark from which direction will be measured needs to be established. One of the most \\ncommon benchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric direction refers to when we use \\nourselves as a directional benchmark. Describing something as \u201cto my left,\u201d \u201cbehind me,\u201d or \u201cnext to me\u201d \\nare examples of egocentric direction. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  18 \\nAs the name suggests, landmark direction uses a known landmark or geographic feature as a benchmark \\nto determine direction. Such landmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point of interest \\nlike the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature like a mountain range or river. The important thing to \\nremember about landmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that the landmark should be \\nrelatively well-known. \\nIn geography and GISs, there are three more standard benchmarks that are used  to define the directions \\nof true north, magnetic north, and grid north. True north is based on the point at which the axis of the \\nearth\u2019s rotation intersects the earth\u2019s surface. In this respect the North and South Poles serve as the \\ngeographic benchmarks for determining direction. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the \\nsurface of the earth where the earth\u2019s magnetic fields converge. This is also the point to which magnetic \\ncompasses point. Note that magnetic north falls somewhere in northern Canada and is not geographically \\ncoincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid north simply refers to the northward direction that the \\ngrid lines of latitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point to.  \\nFigure 1.5 The Three Norths: True, Magnetic, and Grid \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  19 \\nSource: http://kenai.fws.gov/overview/notebook/2004/sept/3sep2004.htm \\nDistance \\nComplementing the concepts of location and direction is distance. Distance refers to the degree or amount \\nof separation between locations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with various units. We \\ncan describe the distances between locations nominally as \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall,\u201d or we can describe two or \\nmore locations as \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar apart.\u201d Absolute distance is measured or calculated using a standard \\nmetric. The formula for the distance between two points on a planar (i.e., flat) surface is the following: \\nD=(x2\u2212x1)2+(y2\u2212y1)2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a \\nCalculating the distance between two locations on the surface of the earth, ho wever, is a bit more involved \\nbecause we are dealing with a three-dimensional object. Moving from the three-dimensional earth to two-\\ndimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile devices is not a trivial matter and is discussed \\nin greater detail in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". \\nWe also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the distance between London and \\nSingapore can be measured in miles, kilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship. \\nWhether or not such distances make London and Singapore \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar\u201d from each other is a matter of \\nopinion, experience, and patience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that derived from \\nthe distance formula, provide a standardized method to measure how far away o r how near locations are \\nfrom each other. \\nSpace \\nWhere distance suggests a measurable quantity in terms of how far apart locations are situated, space is a \\nmore abstract concept that is more commonly described rather than measured. For example, space can be  \\ndescribed as \u201cempty,\u201d \u201cpublic,\u201d or \u201cprivate.\u201d \\nWithin the scope of a GIS, we are interested in space, and in particular, we are interested in what fills \\nparticular spaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this sense,  space is a somewhat \\nambiguous and generic term that is used to denote the general geographic area of interest.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  20 \\nOne kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is topological space. Simply put, topological \\nspace is concerned with the nature of relationships and the connectivity of locations within a given space. \\nWhat is important within topological space are (1) how locations are (or are not) related or connected to \\neach other and (2) the rules that govern such geographic relationships.  \\nTransportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the best illustrations of topological \\nspaces (see Figure 1.6 \"Metro Map from London\" and Figure 1.7 \"Metro Map from Moscow\"). When using \\nsuch maps, we are primarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another along  a transportation \\nnetwork. Certain rules also govern how we can travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible \\nonly at a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular line). Such maps may be of little \\nuse when traveling around a city by car or foot, but they show the local transportation network and how \\nlocations are linked together in an effective and efficient manner.  \\nFigure 1.6 Metro Map from London \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  21 \\nFigure 1.7 Metro Map from Moscow \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  22 \\nNavigation \\nTransportation maps like those discussed previously illustrate how we move through the environments \\nwhere we live, work, and play. This movement and, in particular, destination-oriented travel are generally \\nreferred to as navigation. How we navigate through space is a complex pro cess that blends together our \\nvarious motor skills; technology; mental maps; and awareness of locations, distances, directions, and the \\nspace where we live (Golledge and Stimson 1997). [3] What is more, our geographical knowledge and \\nspatial awareness is continuously updated and changed as we move from one location to another.  \\nThe acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor. Though several factors influence the \\nnature of such knowledge, we tend to rely on the three following types of geograph ic knowledge when \\nnavigating through space: \\n1. Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and identify unique points, patterns, or features \\n(e.g., landmarks) in space. \\n2. Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between landmarks by moving throug h space. \\n3. Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks are in relation to each other and to take \\nshortcuts. \\nEach type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after the other. For instance, when we find \\nourselves in a new or an unfamiliar location, we usually identify a few unique points of interest (e.g., \\nhotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are in essence building up our landmark knowledge. \\nUsing and traveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge and rei nforces our landmark \\nknowledge and our overall geographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin to \\nunderstand how routes connect landmarks together and how various locations are situated in space. It is \\nat this point, when we are somewhat comfortable with our survey knowledge, that we are able to take \\nshortcuts from one location to another. Though there is no guarantee that a shortcut will be successful, if \\nwe get lost, we are at least expanding our local geographic knowledge.  \\nLandmark, route, and survey knowledge are the cornerstones of having a sense of direction and frame our \\ngeographical learning and awareness. While some would argue that they are born with a good sense of \\ndirection, others admit to always getting lost. The popularity of personal navigation devices and online Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  23 \\nmapping services speaks to the overwhelming desire to know and to situate where we are in the world. \\nThough developing and maintaining a keen sense of direction presumably matters less and less as such \\ndevices and services continue to develop and spread, it can also be argued that the more we know about \\nwhere we are in the world, the more we will want to learn about it.  \\nThis section covers concepts essential to geography, GISs, and many other fields of interest. \\nUnderstanding how location, direction, and distance can be defined and described provides an important \\nfoundation for the successful use and implementation of a GIS. Thinking about space and how we \\nnavigate through it also serves to improve and own geographic knowledge and spatial awareness. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Location refers to the position of an object on the surface of the earth and is commonly expressed in \\nterms of latitude and longitude. \\n\u2022 Direction is always determined relative to a benchmark. \\n\u2022 Distance refers to the separation between locations. \\n\u2022 Navigation is the destination-oriented movement through space. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Find your hometown in the GNIS and see what other features share this name. Explore the toponymy of \\nyour hometown online. \\n2. How are GPSs and related navigation technology influencing how we learn about our local environments?  \\n3. Does navigation technology improve or impede our sense of direction and learning about where we live?  \\n4. Compare and contrast the driving directions between two locations provided by two different online \\nmapping services (e.g., Google Maps vs. Yahoo! Maps). Is there a discrepancy? If so, what explanations \\ncan you think of for this difference? Is this the best way to travel between these locations?  \\n \\n[1] Monmonier, M. 1996. How to Lie with Maps.

The objective of this section is to define and describe how a geographic information system (GIS) is \\napplied, its development, and its future. \\nUp to this point, the primary concern of this chapter was to introduce concepts essential to \\ngeography that are also relevant to geographic information systems (GISs). Furthermore, the \\nintroduction of these concepts was prefaced by an overview of how we think spatially and the nature \\nof geographic inquiry. This final section is concerned with defining a GIS, describing its use, and \\nexploring its future. \\nGIS Defined \\nSo what exactly is a GIS? Is it computer software? Is it a collection of computer hardware? I s it a service \\nthat is distributed and accessed via the Internet? Is it a tool? Is it a system? Is it a science? The answer to \\nall these questions is, \u201cGIS is all of the above\u2014 and more.\u201d \\nFrom a software perspective, a GIS consists of a special type of computer program capable of storing, \\nediting, processing, and presenting geographic data and information as maps. There are several GIS \\nsoftware providers, such as Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. ( http://www.esri.com), which \\ndistributes ArcGIS, and PitneyBowes (http://www.pbinsight.com), which distributes MapInfo GIS. \\nThough online mapping services and interfaces are provided by companies like Google, Yahoo!, and \\nMicrosoft, such services are not (yet) considered fully fledged GIS platforms. There are also open -source \\nGIS options, such as GRASS (http://grass.itc.it), which is freely distributed and maintained by the open-\\nsource community. All GIS software, regardless of vendor, consists of a database management system that \\nis capable of handling and integrating two types of data: spatial data and attribute data.  \\nSpatial data refer to the real-world geographic objects of interest, such as streets, buildings, lakes, and \\ncountries, and their respective locations. In addition to location, each of these objects also possesses \\ncertain traits of interest, or attributes, such as a name, number of stories, depth, or population. GIS \\nsoftware keeps track of both the spatial and attribute data and permits us to link the two types of data \\ntogether to create information and facilitate analysis.

Each layer of the cake represents a different geographic theme, \\nsuch as water features, buildings, and roads, and each layer is stacked one on top of another (see  Figure \\n1.8 \"A GIS as a Layered Cake\"). \\nFigure 1.8 A GIS as a Layered Cake \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  26 \\nAs hardware, a GIS consists of a computer, memory, storage devices, scanners, printers, global \\npositioning system (GPS) units, and other physical components. If the computer is situated on a network, \\nthe network can also be considered an integral component of the GIS because it enables us to share data \\nand information that the GIS uses as inputs and creates as outputs.  \\nAs a tool, a GIS permits us to maintain, analyze, and share a wealth of data and information. From the \\nrelatively simple task of mapping the path of a hurricane to the more c omplex task of determining the \\nmost efficient garbage collection routes in a city, a GIS is used across the public and private sectors. \\nOnline and mobile mapping, navigation, and location-based services are also personalizing and \\ndemocratizing GISs by bringing maps and mapping to the masses. \\nThese are just a few definitions of a GIS. Like several of the geographic concepts discussed previously, \\nthere is no single or universally accepted definition of a GIS. There are probably just as many definitions \\nof GISs as there are people who use GISs. In this regard, it is the people like you who are learning, \\napplying, developing, and studying GISs in new and compelling ways that unifies it.  \\nThree Approaches to GISs \\nIn addition to recognizing the many definitions of a GIS, it is also constructive to identify three general \\nand overlapping approaches to understanding GISs\u2014 the application approach, the developer approach, \\nand the science approach. Though most GIS users would probably identify with one approach more than \\nanother, they are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, as GISs and, more generally, information technology \\nadvance, the following categories will be transformed and reshaped accordingly.  \\nThe application approach to GISs considers a GIS primarily to be a tool.  This is also perhaps the most \\ncommon view of a GIS. From this perspective, a GIS is used to answer questions, support decision \\nmaking, maintain an inventory of geographic data and information, and, of course, make maps. As a tool, \\nthere are arguably certain skills that should be acquired and required in order to use and apply a GIS \\nproperly. The application approach to a GIS is more concerned with using and applying GISs to solve \\nproblems than the GIS itself. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  27 \\nFor instance, suppose we want to determine the best location for a new supermarket. What factors are \\nimportant behind making this decision? Information about neighborhood demographics, existing \\nsupermarkets, the location of suppliers, zoning regulations, and available real estate are all critical to th is \\ndecision. A GIS platform can integrate such information that is obtained from the census bureau, realtors, \\nthe local zoning agency, and even the Internet. A suitability analysis can then be carried out with the GIS, \\nthe output of which will show the best locations for the supermarket given the various local geographic \\nopportunities (e.g., demographics/consumers) and constraints (e.g., supply chain, zoning, and real estate \\nlimitations) that exist. \\nThere are several professional communities and organizations concerned with the use and application of a \\nGIS, such as the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association ( http://urisa.org) and the Global \\nSpatial Data Infrastructure Association (http://www.gsdi.org). \\nUnlike the previous example in which a GIS is applied to answer or solve a particular question, the \\ndeveloper approach to GISs is concerned with the development of the GIS as a software or technology \\nplatform. Rather than focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned \\nwith improving, refining, and extending the tool and technology itself and is largely in the realm of \\ncomputer programmers and software developers. \\nThe ongoing integration and evolution of GISs, maps, the Internet, and web-based mapping can be \\nconsidered an outcome of the developer approach to GISs. In this regard, delivering maps, navigation \\ntools, and user-friendly GISs to people via the Internet is the central challenge at hand. The underlying, \\nand to a large extent hidden, logic and computer code that permit us to ask questions about how to get \\nfrom point A to point B on a navigation website or to see where a new restaurant or open house is located \\non a web-based map are for the most part the domain of GIS programmers and developers. The Open \\nSource Geospatial Foundation (http://www.osgeo.org) is another example of a community of GIS \\ndevelopers working to build and distribute open-source GIS software. \\nIt is the developer approach to GISs that drives and introduces innovation and is informed and guided by \\nthe existing needs and future demands of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting \\nedge, it is dynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  28 \\nThe science approach to GISs not only dovetails with the applications and developer approaches but also \\nis more concerned with broader questions and how geography, cognition, m ap interpretation, and other \\ngeospatial issues such as accuracy and errors are relevant to GISs and vice versa (see Longley et al. \\n2005). [1] This particular approach is often referred to as geographic information science (GIScience), and \\nit is also interested in the social consequences and implications of the use and diffusion of GIS technology. \\nFrom exploring the propagation of error to examining how privacy is being redefined by GISs and related \\ntechnology, GIScience is at the same time an agent of change as well as one of understanding. \\nIn light of the rapid rate of technological and GIS innovation, in conjunction with the widespread \\napplication of GISs, new questions about GIS technology and its use are continually emerging. One of the \\nmost discussed topics concerns privacy, and in particular, what is referred to as locational privacy. In \\nother words, who has the right to view or determine your geographic location at any given time? Your \\nparents? Your school? Your employer? Your cell phone carrier? The government or police? When are you \\nwilling to divulge your location? Is there a time or place where you prefer to be \u201coff the grid\u201d or not \\nlocatable? Such questions concerning locational privacy were of relatively little concern a few years ago. \\nHowever, with the advent of GPS and its integration into cars and other mobile devices, questions, \\ndebates, and even lawsuits concerning locational privacy and who has the right to such information are \\nrapidly emerging. \\nAs the name suggests, the developer approach to GISs is concerned with the development of GISs. Rather \\nthan focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned with improving, \\nrefining, and extending the tool itself and is largely in the realm of computer programmers an d software \\ndevelopers. For instance, the advent of web-based mapping is an outcome of the developer approach to \\nGISs. In this regard, the challenge was how to bring GISs to people via the Internet and not necessarily \\nhow people would use web-based GISs. The developer approach to GISs drives and introduces innovation \\nand is guided by the needs of the application approach. As such, it is indeed on the cutting edge, it is \\ndynamic, and it represents an area for considerable growth in the future.  \\nGIS Futures Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  29 \\nThe definitions and approaches to GISs described previously illustrate the scope and breadth of this \\nspecial type of information technology. Furthermore, as GISs become more accessible and widely \\ndistributed, there will always be new questions to be answered, new applications to be developed, and \\ninnovative technologies to integrate. \\nOne notable development is the emergence of what is called the geospatial web. The geospatial web or \\ngeoweb refers to the integration of the vast amounts of content available on t he Internet (e.g., text, \\nphotographs, video, and music) with geographic information, such as location. Adding such geographic \\ninformation to such content is called geotagging and is similar to geocoding. The integration of geographic \\ninformation with such content opens up new ways to access, search, organize, share, and distribute \\ninformation. \\nMapping mashups, or web-based applications that combine data and information from one source and \\nmap it with online mapping applications, are an example of the geoweb  at work. There are mashups for \\nnearly everything that can be assigned a location, from restaurants and music festivals to your \\nphotographs and favorite hikes. Several examples of such mapping mashups can be found on the Internet \\nat sites such as http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com. \\nThough the geoweb may not necessarily be considered a GIS, it certainly draws upon the same concepts \\nand ideas of geography and may someday encompass GISs. Perhaps more important, the diffusion of GISs \\nand the emergence of the geoweb have increased geographic awareness by lowering the barriers of \\nviewing, using, and even creating maps and related geographic data and information. Though there are \\nseveral benefits to this democratization of GISs, and more generally information and technology, it should \\nalso be recognized that there are also consequences and implications.  \\nAs with any other technology, great care must be taken in the use and application of GISs. For instance, \\nwhen was the last time you questioned what appeared on a map? For better or worse, maps are among the \\nmost authoritative forms of information and are the subject of Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". As tomorrow\u2019s \\nGIS practitioners, you will have the ability to influence greatly how decisions are made and how others \\nview and relate to the world with the maps that you create in a GIS environment. What and how you Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  30 \\nchoose to map is therefore a nontrivial exercise. Becoming more aware of our biases, limitations, and \\npreferences permits us to take full advantage of geographic information systems with confidence.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 There is no single or universal definition of a GIS; it is defined and used in many different ways.  \\n\u2022 One of the key features of a GIS is that it integrates spatial data with attribute data. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

This chapter provides the foundations for working with, \\nintegrating, and making maps with GISs. \\n \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  32 \\n2.1 Maps and Map Types \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to define what a map is and to describe reference, thematic, and dynamic \\nmaps. \\nMaps are among the most compelling forms of information for several reasons. Maps are artistic. Maps \\nare scientific. Maps preserve history. Maps clarify. Maps reveal the invisible. Maps inform the future. \\nRegardless of the reason, maps capture the imagination of people around the world. As one of the most \\ntrusted forms of information, map makers and geographic information system (GIS) practitioners hold a \\nconsiderable amount of power and influence (Wood 1992; Monmonier 1996).  [1], [2] Therefore, \\nunderstanding and appreciating maps and how maps convey information are important aspects of GISs. \\nThe appreciation of maps begins with exploring various map types.  \\nSo what exactly is a map? Like GISs, there are probably just as many definitions of maps as there are \\npeople who use and make them (see Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998). [3] For starters, we can define a map \\nsimply as a representation of the world. Such maps can be stored in our brain (i.e., mental maps), they can \\nbe printed on paper, or they can appear online. Notwithstanding the actual medium of the map (e.g., our \\nfleeting thoughts, paper, or digital display), maps represent and describe various aspects of the world. For \\npurposes of clarity, the three types of maps are the reference map, the thematic map, and the dynamic \\nmap. \\nReference Maps \\nThe primary purpose of a reference map is to deliver location information to the map user. Geographic \\nfeatures and map elements on a reference map tend to be treated and represented equally. In other words, \\nno single aspect of a reference map takes precedent over any other aspect. Moreover, reference maps \\ngenerally represent geographic reality accurately. Examples of some common types of reference maps \\ninclude topographic maps such as those created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS; \\nseehttp://topomaps.usgs.gov) and image maps obtained from satellites or aircraft that are available \\nthrough online mapping services. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  33 \\nFigure 2.1 USGS Topographic Map of Boulder, CO \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  34 \\nFigure 2.2 Image Map of Palm Island, Dubai, from NASA \\n \\nThe accuracy of a given reference map is indeed critical to many users. For instance, local governments \\nneed accurate reference maps for land use, zoning, and tax purposes. National governments need accurate \\nreference maps for political, infrastructure, and military purposes. People who depend on navigation \\ndevices like global positioning system (GPS) units also need accurate and up -to-date reference maps in \\norder to arrive at their desired destinations. \\nThematic Maps \\nContrasting the reference map are thematic maps. As the name suggests, thematic  maps are concerned \\nwith a particular theme or topic of interest. While reference maps emphasize the location of geographic \\nfeatures, thematic maps are more concerned with how things are distributed across space . Such things are \\noften abstract concepts such as life expectancy around the world, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \\nin Europe, or literacy rates across India. One of the strengths of mapping, and in particular of thematic \\nmapping, is that it can make such abstract and invisible concepts visible and comparable on a map.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  35 \\nFigure 2.3 World Life Expectancies \\n \\nFigure 2.4 European GDP \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  36 \\nFigure 2.5 Indian Literacy Rates \\n \\nIt is important to note that reference and thematic maps are not mutually exclusive. In other words, \\nthematic maps often contain and combine geographical reference information, and conversely, reference \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  37 \\nmaps may contain thematic information. What is more, when used in conjunction, thematic and reference \\nmaps often complement each other. \\nFor example, public health officials in a city may be interested in providing equal access to emergency \\nrooms to the city\u2019s residents. Insights into this and related questions can be obtained through visual \\ncomparisons of a reference map that shows the locations of emergency rooms across the city to thematic \\nmaps of various segments of the population (e.g., households below poverty, percent elderly, \\nunderrepresented groups). \\nWithin the context of a GIS, we can overlay the reference map of emergency rooms directly on top of the \\npopulation maps to see whether or not access is uniform across neighborhood types. Clearly, there are \\nother factors to consider when looking at emergency room access (e.g., access to transport), but through \\nsuch map overlays, underserved neighborhoods can be identified. \\nFigure 2.6 Map Overlay Process \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  38 \\nWhen presented in hardcopy format, both reference and thematic maps are static or fixed representations \\nof reality. Such permanence on the page suggests that geography and the things that we map are also in \\nmany ways fixed or constant. This is far from reality. The integration of GISs with other forms of \\ninformation technology like the Internet and mobile telecommunications is rapidly changing this view of \\nmaps and mapping, as well as geography at large. \\nDynamic Maps \\nThe diffusion of GISs and the popularity of online mapping tools and applications speak to this shift in \\nthinking about maps and map use. In this regard, it is worthwhile to discuss the diffusion of dynamic \\nmaps. Dynamic maps are simply changeable or interactive representations of the earth. Dynamic mapping \\nrefers more to how maps are used and delivered to the map user today (e.g., online, via mobile phone) \\nthan to the content of the map itself. Both reference and thematic maps can be dynamic in nature, and \\nsuch maps are an integral component to any GIS. The key point about dynamic maps is that more and \\nmore people, not just GIS professionals, have access to such maps. \\nUnlike a hardcopy map that has features and elements users cannot modify or change, dynamic maps \\nencourage and sometimes require user interaction. Such interaction can include changing the scale or \\nvisible area by zooming in or zooming out, selecting which features or layers to include or to remove from \\na map (e.g., roads, imagery), or even starting and stopping a map animation.  \\nFigure 2.7 Google Maps on an iPhone \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  39 \\nFigure 2.8 Polar Ice Cap \\n \\nTo see the animation, go to http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?3464. \\nJust as dynamic maps will continue to evolve and require more user interaction in the future, map users \\nwill demand more interactive map features and controls. As this democratization of maps and mapping \\ncontinues, the geographic awareness and map appreciation of map users will also increase. Therefore, it is \\nof critical importance to understand the nature, form, and content of maps to support the changing needs , \\ndemands, and expectations of map users in the future. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The main purpose of a reference map is to show the location of geographical objects of interest.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  40 \\n\u2022 Thematic maps are concerned with showing how one or more geographical aspects are distributed across \\nspace. \\n\u2022 Dynamic maps refer to maps that are changeable and often require user interaction.  \\n\u2022 The democratization of maps and mapping is increasing access, use, and appreciation for all types of \\nmaps, as well as driving map innovations. \\n \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to describe and discuss the concepts of map scale, coordinate systems, and \\nmap projections and explain why they are central to maps, mapping, and geographic information systems \\n(GISs). \\nAll map users and map viewers have certain expectations about what is contained on a map. Such \\nexpectations are formed and learned from previous experience by working with maps. It is important \\nto note that such expectations also change with increased exposure to maps. Understanding and \\nmeeting the expectations of map viewers is a challenging but necessary task because such \\nexpectations provide a starting point for the creation of any map. \\nThe central purpose of a map is to provide relevant and useful information to the map user. In order \\nfor a map to be of value, it must convey information effectively and efficiently. Mapping conventions \\nfacilitate the delivery of information in such a manner by recognizing and managing the expectations \\nof map users. Generally speaking, mapping or cartographic conventions refer to the accepted rules, \\nnorms, and practices behind the making of maps. One of the most recognized mapping conventions \\nis that \u201cnorth is up\u201d on most maps. Though this may not always be the case, many map users expect \\nnorth to be oriented or to coincide with the top edge of a map or viewing device like a computer \\nmonitor. \\nSeveral other formal and informal mapping conventions and characteristics, many of which are \\ntaken for granted, can be identified. Among the most important cartographic considerations are map \\nscale, coordinate systems, and map projections. Map scale is concerned with reducing geographical \\nfeatures of interest to manageable proportions, coordinate systems help us define the positions of \\nfeatures on the surface of the earth, and map projections are concerned with moving from the three-\\ndimensional world to the two dimensions of a flat map or display, all of which are discussed in \\ngreater detail in this chapter. \\nMap Scale Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  42 \\nThe world is a big place\u2026really big. One of the challenges behind mapping the world and its resident \\nfeatures, patterns, and processes is reducing it to a manageable size. What exactly is meant by \\n\u201cmanageable\u201d is open to discussion and largely depends on the purpose and needs of the map at hand. \\nNonetheless, all maps reduce or shrink the world and its geographic features of interest by some \\nfactor. Map scale refers to the factor of reduction of the world so it fits on a map.  \\nMap scale can be represented by text, a graphic, or some combination of the two. For example, it is \\ncommon to see \u201cone inch represents one kilometer\u201d or something similar written on a map to give map \\nusers an idea of the scale of the map. Map scale can also be portrayed graphically with what is called a \\nscale bar. Scale bars are usually used on reference maps and allow map users to approximate distances \\nbetween locations and features on a map, as well as to get an overall idea of the scale of the map.  \\nFigure 2.9 Map Scale from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Map \\n \\nThe representative fraction (RF) describes scale as a simple ratio. The numerator, which is always set to \\none (i.e., 1), denotes map distance and the denominator denotes ground or \u201creal-world\u201d distance. One of \\nthe benefits of using a representative fraction to describe scale is that it is unit neutral. In other words, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  43 \\nany unit of measure can be used to interpret the map scale. Consider a map with an RF of 1:10,000. This \\nmeans that one unit on the map represents 10,000 units on the ground. Such units could be inches, \\ncentimeters, or even pencil lengths; it really does not matter. \\nMap scales can also be described as either \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge.\u201d Such descriptions are usually made in \\nreference to representative fractions and the amount of detail represented on a map. For instance, a map \\nwith an RF of 1:1,000 is considered a large-scale map when compared to a map with an RF of 1:1,000,000 \\n(i.e., 1:1,000 > 1:1,000,000). Furthermore, while the large-scale map shows more detail and less area, the \\nsmall-scale map shows more area but less detail. Clearly, determining the thresholds for small - or large-\\nscale maps is largely a judgment call. \\nAll maps possess a scale, whether it is formally expressed or not. Though some say that online maps and \\nGISs are \u201cscaleless\u201d because we can zoom in and out at will, it is probably more accurate to say that GISs \\nand related mapping technology are multiscalar. Understanding map scale and its overall impact on h ow \\nthe earth and its features are represented is a critical part of both map making and GISs.  \\nCoordinate Systems \\nJust as all maps have a map scale, all maps have locations, too. Coordinate  systems are frameworks that \\nare used to define unique positions. For instance, in geometry we use x (horizontal) and y (vertical) \\ncoordinates to define points on a two-dimensional plane. The coordinate system that is most commonly \\nused to define locations on the three-dimensional earth is called the geographic coordinate system (GCS), \\nand it is based on a sphere or spheroid. A spheroid (a.k.a. ellipsoid  is simply a sphere that is slightly wider \\nthan it is tall and approximates more closely the true shape of the earth. Spheres are commonly used as \\nmodels of the earth for simplicity. \\nThe unit of measure in the GCS is degrees, and locations are defined by their respective latitude and \\nlongitude within the GCS. Latitude is measured relative to the equator at zero degrees, with maxima of \\neither ninety degrees north at the North Pole or ninety degrees south at the South Pole. Longitude is \\nmeasured relative to the prime meridian at zero degrees, with maxima of 180 degrees west or 180 degrees \\neast. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  44 \\nNote that latitude and longitude can be expressed in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) or in decimal \\ndegrees (DD). When using decimal degrees, latitudes above the equator and longitudes east of the prime \\nmeridian are positive, and latitudes below the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian are \\nnegative (see the following table for examples). \\n \\nNominal location Absolute location (DMS) Absolute location (DD) \\nLos Angeles, US 34\u00b0 3\u2032 North, 118\u00b0 15\u2032 West +34.05, \u2013118.25 \\nMumbai, India 18\u00b0 58\u2032 North, 72\u00b0 49\u2032 East +18.975, +72.8258 \\nSydney, Australia 33\u00b0 51\u2032 South, 151\u00b0 12\u2032 East \u201333.859, 151.211 \\nSao Paolo, Brazil 23\u00b0 33\u2032 South, 46\u00b0 38\u2032 West \u201323.550, \u201346.634 \\nConverting from DMS to DD is a relatively straightforward exercise. For example, since there are sixty \\nminutes in one degree, we can convert 118\u00b0 15 minutes to 118.25 (118 + 15/60). Note that an online search \\nof the term \u201ccoordinate conversion\u201d will return several coordinate conversion tools. \\nWhen we want to map things like mountains, rivers, streets, and buildings, we need to define how the \\nlines of latitude and longitude will be oriented and positioned on the sphere. A datum serves this purpose \\nand specifies exactly the orientation and origins of the lines of latitude and longitude relative to the center \\nof the earth or spheroid. \\nDepending on the need, situation, and location, there are several datums to choose from. For instance, \\nlocal datums try to match closely the spheroid to the earth\u2019s surface in a local area and return accurate \\nlocal coordinates. A common local datum used in the United States is  called NAD83 (i.e., North American \\nDatum of 1983). For locations in the United States and Canada, NAD83 returns relatively accurate \\npositions, but positional accuracy deteriorates when outside of North America.  \\nThe global WGS84 datum (i.e., World Geodetic System of 1984) uses the center of the earth as the origin \\nof the GCS and is used for defining locations across the globe. Because the datum uses the center of the \\nearth as its origin, locational measurements tend to be more consistent regardless where th ey are \\nobtained on the earth, though they may be less accurate than those returned by a local datum. Note that \\nswitching between datums will alter the coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) for all locations of \\ninterest. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  45 \\nMap Projections \\nPreviously we noted that the earth is really big. Not only is it big, but it is a big round spherical shape \\ncalled a spheroid. A globe is a very common and very good representation of the three- dimensional, \\nspheroid earth. One of the problems with globes, however, is that they are not very portable (i.e., you \\ncannot fold a globe and put in it in your pocket), and their small scale makes them of limited practical use \\n(i.e., geographic detail is sacrificed). To overcome these issues, it is necessary to transform the three -\\ndimensional shape of the earth to a two-dimensional surface like a flat piece of paper, computer screen, or \\nmobile device display in order to obtain more useful map forms and map scales. Enter the map projection.  \\nMap projections refer to the methods and procedures that are used to transform the spherical three-\\ndimensional earth into two-dimensional planar surfaces. Specifically, map projections are mathematical \\nformulas that are used to translate latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth to  x and y \\ncoordinates on a plane. Since there are an infinite number of ways this translation can be performed, \\nthere are an infinite number of map projections. The mathematics behind map projections are beyond the \\nscope of this introductory overview (but see Robinson et al. 1995; Muehrcke and Muehrcke 1998), [1] and \\nfor simplicity, the following discussion focuses on describing types of map projections, the distortions \\ninherent to map projections, and the selection of appropriate map projections.  \\nTo illustrate the concept of a map projection, imagine that we place a light bulb in the center of a \\ntranslucent globe. On the globe are outlines of the continents and the lines of longitude and latitude called \\nthe graticule. When we turn the light bulb on, the outline of the continents and the graticule will be \\n\u201cprojected\u201d as shadows on the wall, ceiling, or any other nearby surface. This is what is meant by map \\n\u201cprojection.\u201d \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  46 \\nFigure 2.10 The Concept of Map \u201cProjection\u201d \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps and mapping, there are three surfaces used for map projections (i.e., surfaces \\non which we project the shadows of the graticule). These surfaces are the plane, the cylinder, and the \\ncone. Referring again to the previous example of a light bulb in the center of a globe, note that during the \\nprojection process, we can situate each surface in any number of ways. For example, surfaces can be \\ntangential to the globe along the equator or poles, they can pass through or intersect the surfa ce, and they \\ncan be oriented at any number of angles. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  47 \\nFigure 2.11 Map Projection Surfaces \\n \\nIn fact, naming conventions for many map projections include the surface as well as its orientation. For \\nexample, as the name suggests, \u201cplanar\u201d projections use the plane, \u201ccylindrical\u201d projections use cylinders, \\nand \u201cconic\u201d projections use the cone. For cylindrical projections, the \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d aspect refers \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  48 \\nto when the cylinder is tangential to the equator (i.e., the axis of the cylinder is oriented north \u2013south). \\nWhen the axis of the cylinder is perfectly oriented east\u2013west, the aspect is called \u201ctransverse,\u201d and all \\nother orientations are referred to as \u201coblique.\u201d Regardless the orientation or the surface on which a \\nprojection is based, a number of distortions will be introduced that will influence the choice of map \\nprojection. \\nWhen moving from the three-dimensional surface of the earth to a two-dimensional plane, distortions are \\nnot only introduced but also inevitable. Generally, map projections introduce  distortions in distance, \\nangles, and areas. Depending on the purpose of the map, a series of trade -offs will need to be made with \\nrespect to such distortions. \\nMap projections that accurately represent distances are referred to as equidistant projections. Note that \\ndistances are only correct in one direction, usually running north\u2013south, and are not correct everywhere \\nacross the map. Equidistant maps are frequently used for small-scale maps that cover large areas because \\nthey do a good job of preserving the shape of geographic features such as continents. \\nMaps that represent angles between locations, also referred to as bearings, are called conformal. \\nConformal map projections are used for navigational purposes due to the importance of maintaining a \\nbearing or heading when traveling great distances. The cost of preserving bearings is that areas tend to be \\nquite distorted in conformal map projections. Though shapes are more or less preserved over small areas, \\nat small scales areas become wildly distorted. The Mercator projection is an example of a conformal \\nprojection and is famous for distorting Greenland. \\nAs the name indicates, equal area or equivalent projections preserve the quality of area. Such projections \\nare of particular use when accurate measures or comparisons of geographical distributions are necessary \\n(e.g., deforestation, wetlands). In an effort to maintain true proportions in the surface of the earth, \\nfeatures sometimes become compressed or stretched depending on the orientation of the projection.  \\nMoreover, such projections distort distances as well as angular relationships.  \\nAs noted earlier, there are theoretically an infinite number of map projections to choose from. One of the \\nkey considerations behind the choice of map projection is to reduce the amount of distortion. The \\ngeographical object being mapped and the respective scale at which the map will be constructed are also Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  49 \\nimportant factors to think about. For instance, maps of the North and South Poles usually use planar or \\nazimuthal projections, and conical projections are best suited for the middle latitude areas of the earth. \\nFeatures that stretch east\u2013west, such as the country of Russia, are represented well with the standard \\ncylindrical projection, while countries oriented north\u2013south (e.g., Chile, Norway) are better represented \\nusing a transverse projection. \\nIf a map projection is unknown, sometimes it can be identified by working backward and examining \\nclosely the nature and orientation of the graticule (i.e., grid of latitude and longitu de), as well as the \\nvarying degrees of distortion. Clearly, there are trade-offs made with regard to distortion on every map. \\nThere are no hard-and-fast rules as to which distortions are more preferred over others. Therefore, the \\nselection of map projection largely depends on the purpose of the map. \\nWithin the scope of GISs, knowing and understanding map projections are critical. For instance, in order \\nto perform an overlay analysis like the one described earlier, all map layers need to be in the same \\nprojection. If they are not, geographical features will not be aligned properly, and any analyses performed \\nwill be inaccurate and incorrect. Most GISs include functions to assist in the identification of map \\nprojections, as well as to transform between projections in order to synchronize spatial data. Despite the \\ncapabilities of technology, an awareness of the potential and pitfalls that surround map projections is \\nessential. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map scale refers to the factor by which the real world is reduced to fit on a map.  \\n\u2022 A GIS is multiscalar. \\n\u2022 Map projections are mathematical formulas used to transform the three -dimensional earth to two \\ndimensions (e.g., paper maps, computer monitors). \\n\u2022 Map projections introduce distortions in distance, direction, and area.  \\nEXE RCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the decision-making process behind maps and to underscore \\nthe need to be explicit and consistent when mapping and using geographic information systems (GISs).  \\nAs previously discussed, maps are a representation of the earth. Central to this representation is the \\nreduction of the earth and its features of interest to a manageable size (i.e., map scale) and its \\ntransformation into a useful two-dimensional form (i.e., map projection). The choice of both map \\nscale and, to a lesser extent, map projection will influence the content and shape of the map. \\nIn addition to the seemingly objective decisions made behind the choices of map scale and map \\nprojection are those concerning what to include and what to omit from the map. The purpose of a \\nmap will certainly guide some of these decisions, but other choices may be based on factors such as \\nspace limitations, map complexity, and desired accuracy. Furthermore, decisions about how to \\nclassify, simplify, or exaggerate features and how to symbolize objects of interest simultaneously fall \\nunder the realms of art and science (Slocum et al. 2004). [1] \\nThe process of moving from the \u201creal world\u201d to the world of maps is referred to as map abstraction. \\nThis process not only involves making choices about how to represent features but also, more \\nimportant with regard to geographic information systems (GISs), requires us to be explicit, \\nconsistent, and precise in terms of defining and describing geographical features of interest. Failure \\nto be explicit, consistent, and precise will return incorrect; inconsistent; and error-prone maps, \\nanalyses, and decisions based on such maps and GISs. This final section discusses map abstraction in \\nterms of geographical features and their respective graphical representation. \\nWhat Is a Forest? \\nOne of the most pressing environmental issues facing the world is deforestation. Generally, deforestation \\nrefers to the reduction of forest area. This is an important issue because it has possible implications for \\nclimate change, global warming, biodiversity, and the water balance of the earth, among other things. In \\nthe last century, deforestation has increased at an alarming rate and is mostly attributed to human Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  52 \\nactivity. Mapping forests regularly with a GIS is a logical way to monitor deforestation and has the \\npotential to inform policies regarding forest conservation efforts. Easy enough, so let\u2019s get started. \\nSo what exactly is a forest? How do we know where a forest begins and where it ends? How can naturally \\ncaused forest fires be differentiated from those started by humans? Can a forest exist in a swamp or \\nwetland? For that matter, what is the difference between a swamp and wetland? Such questions are  not \\ntrivial in the context of mapping and GISs. In fact, consistent and precise definitions of features like \\nforests or swamps increase the reliability and efficiency of maps, mapping, and analysis with GISs.  \\nFigure 2.12 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2001 \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  53 \\nFigure 2.13 Deforestation in the Amazon: 2009 \\n \\nWithin the realm of maps, cartography, and GISs, the world is made up of various features or entities. \\nSuch entities include but are not restricted to fire hydrants, caves, roads, rivers, lakes, hills, va lleys, \\noceans, and the occasional barn. Moreover, such features have a form, and more precisely, a geometric \\nform. For instance, fire hydrants and geysers are considered point-like features; rivers and streams are \\nlinear features; and lakes, countries, and forests are areal features. \\nFeatures can also be categorized as either discrete or continuous. Discrete  features are well defined and \\nare easy to locate, measure, and count, and their edges or boundaries are readily defined. Examples of \\ndiscrete features in a city include buildings, roads, traffic signals, and parks. Continuous  features, on the \\nother hand, are less well defined and exist across space. The most commonly cited examples of continuous \\nfeatures are temperature and elevation. Changes in both temperature and elevation tend to be gradual \\nover relatively large areas. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  54 \\nGeographical features also have several characteristics, traits, or attributes that may or may not be of \\ninterest. For instance, to continue the deforestation example, determining wheth er a forest is a rainforest \\nor whether a forest is in a protected park may be important. More general attributes may include \\nmeasurements such as tree density per acre, average canopy height in meters, or proportions like percent \\npalm trees or invasive species per hectare in the forest. \\nNotwithstanding the purpose of the map or GIS project at hand, it is critical that definitions of features \\nare clear and remain consistent. Similarly, it is important that the attributes of features are also \\nconsistently defined, measured, and reported in order to generate accurate and effective maps in an \\nefficient manner. Defining features and attributes of interest is often an iterative process of trial and error. \\nBeing able to associate a feature with a particular geometric form and to determine the fea ture type are \\ncentral to map abstraction, facilitate mapping, and the application of GISs.  \\nMap Content and Generalization \\nThe shape and content of maps vary according to purpose, need, and resources, among other factors. \\nWhat is common to most maps, and in particular to those within a GIS, is that they are graphical \\nrepresentations of reality. Put another way, various graphical symbols are used to represent geographical \\nfeatures or entities. Annotation or text is also commonly used on maps and facilitates m ap interpretation. \\nLearning about map content and map generalization is important because they serve as the building \\nblocks for spatial data that are used within a GIS. \\nBuilding upon the previous discussion about the geometric form of geographic features, maps typically \\nrely on three geometric objects: the point, the line, and the polygon or area. A point is defined \\nby x and y coordinates, a line is defined by two points, and a polygon is defined by a minimum of three \\npoints. The important thing to note is that the definition of a point is analogous to a location that is \\ndefined by longitude and latitude. Furthermore, since lines and polygons are made up of points, location \\ninformation (i.e., x and y, or longitude and latitude, coordinates) is intrinsic to points, lines, and polygons. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  55 \\nFigure 2.14 Geographic Features as Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nBoth simple and complex maps can be made using these three relatively simple geometric objects. \\nAdditionally, by changing the graphical characteristics of each object, an infinite number of mapping \\npossibilities emerge. Such changes can be made to the respective size, shape, color, and patterns of points, \\nlines, and polygons. For instance, different sized points can be used to reflect variations in population \\nsize, line color or line size (i.e., thickness) can be used to denote volume or the amount of interaction \\nbetween locations, and different colors and shapes can be used to reflect different values of interest.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  56 \\nFigure 2.15 Variations in the Graphical Parameters of Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nFigure 2.16 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  57 \\nComplementing the graphical elements described previously is annotation or text. Annotation is used to \\nidentify particular geographic features, such as cities, states, bodies of water, or other points of i nterest. \\nLike the graphical elements, text can be varied according to size, orientation, or color. There are also \\nnumerous text fonts and styles that are incorporated into maps. For example, bodies of water are often \\nlabeled in italics. \\nAnother map element that deserves to be mentioned and that combines both graphics and text is the map \\nlegend or map key. A map legend provides users information about the how geographic information is \\nrepresented graphically. Legends usually consist of a title that describes the map, as well as the various \\nsymbols, colors, and patterns that are used on the map. Such information is often vital to the proper \\ninterpretation of a map. \\nAs more features and graphical elements are put on a given map, the need to generalize such feat ures \\narises. Map generalization refers to the process of resolving conflicts associated with too much detail, too \\nmany features, or too much information to map. In particular, generalization can take several forms \\n(Buttenfield and McMaster 1991): [2] \\n\u2022 The simplification or symbolization of features for emphasis \\n\u2022 The masking or displacement of detail to increase clarity or legibility  \\n\u2022 The selection of detail for inclusion or omission from the map \\n\u2022 The exaggeration of features for emphasis \\nDetermining which aspects of generalization to use is largely a matter of personal preference, experience, \\nmap purpose, and trial and error. Though there are general guidelines about map generalization, there are \\nno universal standards or requirements with regard to the generalization of maps and mapping. It is at \\nthis point that cartographic and artistic license, prejudices and biases, and creativity and design sense \u2014 or \\nlack thereof\u2014 emerge to shape the map. \\nMaking a map and, more generally, the process of mapping involve a range of decisions and choices. From \\nthe selection of the appropriate map scale and map projection to deciding which features to map and to \\nomit, mapping is a complex blend of art and science. In fact, many historical maps are indeed viewed like \\nworks of art, and rightly so. Learning about the scale, shape, and content of maps serves to increase our Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  58 \\nunderstanding of maps, as well as deepen our appreciation of maps and map making. Ultimately, this \\nincreased geographical awareness and appreciation of maps promotes the sound and effective use and \\napplication of a GIS. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Map abstraction refers to the process of explicitly defining and representing real -world features on a \\nmap. \\n\u2022 The three basic geometric forms of geographical features are the point, line, a nd polygon (or area). \\n\u2022 Map generalization refers to resolving conflicts that arise on a map due to limited space, too many \\ndetails, or too much information. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Such maps can be found on the news, \\nthe Internet, in your car, and on your mobile phone. What\u2019s more is that such images are in living color \\nand of very high resolution. Not long ago, such image maps from satellites were the sole domain of \\nmeteorologists, local weather forecasters, and various government agencies. Public access to such images \\nwas pretty much limited to the evening news. \\nTechnological advances in imaging technology, in conjunction with the commercialization of space flight, \\nopened the door for companies like GeoEye (http://www.geoeye.com) and DigitalGlobe \\n(http://www.digitalglobe.com) to provide satellite imagery and maps to the masses at the turn of the \\ntwenty-first century.

What\u2019s more is that \\nthe process of mapping has also been decentralized and democratized so that many more people not \\nonly have access to maps but also are enabled and empowered to create their own maps. This \\ndemocratization of maps and mapping is in large part attributable to a shift to digital map \\nproduction and consumption. Unlike analog or hardcopy maps that are static or fixed once they are \\nprinted onto paper, digital maps are highly changeable, exchangeable, and as noted in Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", dynamic in terms of scale, form, and content. \\nTo understand digital maps and mapping, it is necessary to put them into the context of computing \\nand information technology. First, this chapter provides an introduction to the building blocks of \\ndigital maps and geographic information systems (GISs), with particular emphasis placed upon how \\ndata and information are stored as files on a computer. Second, key issues and considerations as they \\nrelate to data acquisition and data standards are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion \\nof where data for use with a GIS can be found. This chapter serves as the bridge between the \\nconceptual materials presented in Chapter 1 \"Introduction\" and Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\"and the \\nchapters that follow, which contain more formal discussions about the use and application of a GIS. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  61 \\n3.1 Data and Information \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to define and describe data and information and how it is organized into \\nfiles for use in a computing and geographic information system (GIS) environment.  \\nTo understand how we get from analog to digital maps, let\u2019s begin with the building blocks and \\nfoundations of the geographic information system (GIS)\u2014 namely, data and information. As already \\nnoted on several occasions, GIS stores, edits, processes, and presents data and information. But what \\nexactly is data? And what exactly is information? For many, the terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d refer \\nto the same thing. For our purposes, it is useful to make a distinction between the two. \\nGenerally, data refer to facts, measurements, characteristics, or traits of an object of interest. For \\nyou grammar sticklers out there, note that \u201cdata\u201d is the plural form of \u201cdatum.\u201d For example, we can \\ncollect all kinds of data about all kinds of things, like the length of rainbow trout in a Colorado \\nstream, the number of vegetarians in Alaska, the diameter of mahogany tree trunks in the Brazilian \\nrainforest, student scores on the last GIS midterm, the altitude of mountain peaks in Nepal, the \\ndepth of snow in the Austrian Alps, or the number of people who use public transportation to get to \\nwork in London. \\nOnce data are put into context, used to answer questions, situated within analytical frameworks, or \\nused to obtain insights, they become information. For our purposes, information simply refers to \\nthe knowledge of value obtained through the collection, interpretation, and/or analysis of data. \\nThough a computer is not necessary to collect, record, manipulate, process, or visualize data, or to \\nprocess it into information, information technology can be of great help. For instance, computers can \\nautomate repetitive tasks, store data efficiently in terms of space and cost, and provide a range of \\ntools for analyzing data from spreadsheets to GISs, of course. What\u2019s more is the fact that the \\nincredible amount of data collected each and every day by satellites, grocery store product scanners, \\ntraffic sensors, temperature gauges, and your mobile phone carrier, to name just a few, would not be \\npossible without the aid and innovation of information technology. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  62 \\nSince this is a text about GISs, it is useful to also define geographic data. Like generic \\ndata, geographic or spatial data refer to geographic facts, measurements, or characteristics of an \\nobject that permit us to define its location on the surface of the earth. Such data include but are not \\nrestricted to the latitude and longitude coordinates of points of interest, street addresses, postal \\ncodes, political boundaries, and even the names of places of interest. It is also important to note and \\nreemphasize the difference between geographic data and attribute data, which was discussed \\nin Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\". Where geographic data are concerned with defining the location of an \\nobject of interest, attribute data are concerned with its nongeographic traits and characteristics. \\nTo illustrate the distinction between geographic and attribute data, think about your home where \\nyou grew up or where you currently live. Within the context of this discussion, we can associate both \\ngeographic and attribute data to it. For instance, we can define the location of your home many ways, \\nsuch as with a street address, the street names of the nearest intersection, the postal code where your \\nhome is located, or we could use a global positioning system\u2013enabled device to obtain latitude and \\nlongitude coordinates. What is important is geographic data permit us to define the location of an \\nobject (i.e., your home) on the surface of the earth. \\nIn addition to the geographic data that define the location of your home are the attribute data that \\ndescribe the various qualities of your home. Such data include but are not restricted to the number of \\nbedrooms and bathrooms in your home, whether or not your home has central heat, the year when \\nyour home was built, the number of occupants, and whether or not there is a swimming pool. These \\nattribute data tell us a lot about your home but relatively little about where it is. \\nNot only is it useful to recognize and understand how geographic and attribute data differ and \\ncomplement each other, but it is also of central importance when learning about and using GISs. \\nBecause a GIS requires and integrates these two distinct types of data, being able to differentiate \\nbetween geographic and attribute data is the first step in organizing your GIS. Furthermore, being \\nable to determine which kinds of data you need will ultimately aid in your implementation and use of \\na GIS. More often than not, and in the age and context of information technology, the data and \\ninformation discussed thus far is the stuff of computer files, which are the focus of the next section. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  63 \\nOf Files and Formats\u2026 \\nWhen we collect data about your home, rainforests, or anything, really, we usually need to put them \\nsomewhere. Though we may scribble numbers and measures on the back of an envelope or write them \\ndown on a pad of paper, if we want to update, share, analyze, or map them in the future, it is often useful \\nto record them in digital form so a computer can read them. Though we won\u2019t bother ourselves with the \\nbits and bytes of computing, it is necessary to discuss some basic elements of computing that are both \\nrelevant and required when learning and working with a GIS. \\nOne of the most common elements of working with computers and computing itself is the file. Files in a \\ncomputer can contain any number of things from a complex set of instructions (e.g., a computer program) \\nto a list of numbers and letters (e.g., address book). Furthermore, computer files come in all different sizes \\nand types. One of the clues we can use to distinguish one file from another is the file extension. The file \\nextension refers to the letters that follow the period (\u201c.\u201d) after the name of the file. Table 3.1 contains some \\nof the most common file extensions and the types of files with which they are associated.  \\nTable 3.1 \\nfilename.txt Simple text file \\nfilename.doc Microsoft Word document \\nfilename.pdf Adobe portable document format \\nfilename.jpg Compressed image file \\nfilename.tif Tagged image format \\nfilename.html Hypertext markup language (used to create web pages) \\nfilename.xml Extensible markup language \\nfilename.zip Zipped/compressed archive \\nSome computer programs may be able to read or work with only certain file types, while others are more \\nadept at reading multiple file formats. What you will realize as you begin to work  more with information \\ntechnology, and GISs in particular, is that familiarity with different file types is important. Learning how \\nto convert or export one file type to another is also a very useful and valuable skill to obtain. In this \\nregard, being able to recognize and knowing how to identify different and unfamiliar file types will \\nundoubtedly increase your proficiency with computers and GISs. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  64 \\nOf the numerous file types that exist, one of the most common and widely accessed file is the simple \\ntext, plain text, or just text file. Simple text files can be read widely by word processing programs, \\nspreadsheet and database programs, and web browsers. Often ending with the extension \u201c.txt\u201d \\n(i.e.,filename.txt), text files contain no special formatting (e.g., bold, italic, underlining) and contain only \\nalphanumeric characters. In other words, images or complex graphics are not well suited for text files. \\nText files, however, are ideal for recording, sharing, and exchanging data because most computers and \\noperating systems can recognize and read simple text files with programs called text editors.  \\nWhen a text file contains data that are organized or structured in some fashion, it is sometimes called a \\nflat file (but the file extension remains the same, i.e., .txt). Generally, flat files are organized in a tabular \\nformat or line by line. In other words, each line or row of the file contains one and only one record. So if \\nwe collected height measurements on three people, Tim, Jake, and Harry, the file might look som ething \\nlike this: \\nName Height \\nTim 6\u20191\u201d \\nJake 5\u20199\u201d \\nHarry 6\u20192\u201d \\nEach row corresponds to one and only one record, observation or case. There are two other important \\nelements to know about this file. First, note that the first row does not contain any data; rather, it provides \\na description of the data contained in each column. When the first row of a file contains such descriptors, \\nit is referred to as a header row or just a header. Columns in a flat file are also called \\nfields, variables, or attributes. \u201cHeight\u201d is the attribute, field, or variable that we are interested in, and \\nthe observations or cases in our data set are \u201cTim,\u201d \u201cJake,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d In short, rows are for records; \\ncolumns are for fields. \\nThe second unseen but critical element to the file is the spaces in between each column or field. In the \\nexample, it appears as though a space separates the \u201cname\u201d column from the \u201cheight\u201d column. Upon \\ncloser inspection, however, note how the initial values of the \u201cheight\u201d column are aligned. If a single space \\nwas being used to separate each column, the height column would not be aligned. In this case a tab is \\nbeing used to separate the columns of each row. The character that is used to separate columns within a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  65 \\nflat file is called the delimiter or separator. Though any character can be used as a delimiter, the most \\ncommon delimiters are the tab, the comma, and a single space. The following are examples of each.  \\nTab-Delimited Single-Space-Delimited Comma-Delimited \\nName     Height Name Height Name, Height \\nTim     6.1 Tim 6.1 Tim, 6.1 \\nJake     5.9 Jake 5.9 Jake, 5.9 \\nHarry     6.2 Harry 6.2 Harry, 6.2 \\nKnowing the delimiter to a flat file is important because it enables us to distinguish and separate the \\ncolumns efficiently and without error. Sometimes such files are referred to by their delimiter, such as a \\n\u201ccomma-separated values\u201d file or a \u201ctab-delimited\u201d file. \\nWhen recording and working with geographic data, the same general format is applied. Rows are reserved \\nfor records, or in the case of geographic data, locations and columns or fields are used for the attributes or \\nvariables associated with each location. For example, the following tab-delimited flat file contains data for \\nthree places (i.e., countries) and three attributes or characteristics of eac h country (i.e., population, \\nlanguage, continent) as noted by the header. \\nCountry Population Language Continent \\nFrance 65,000,000 French Europe \\nBrazil 192,000,000 Portuguese South America \\nAustralia 22,000,000 English Australia \\nFiles like those presented here are the building blocks of the various tables, charts, reports, graphs, and \\nother visualizations that we see each and every day online, in print, and on television. They are also key \\ncomponents to the maps and geographic representations created by GISs. Rarely if ever, however, will you \\nwork with one and only one file or file type. More often than not, and especially when working with GISs, \\nyou will work with multiple files. Such a grouping of multiple files is called a  database. Since the files \\nwithin a database may be different sizes, shapes, and even formats, we need to devise some type of system \\nthat will allow us to work, update, edit, integrate, share, and display the various data within the database. \\nSuch a system is generally referred to as a database management system (DBMS). Databases and DBMSs \\nare so important to GISs that a later chapter is dedicated to them. For now it is enough to remember that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  66 \\nfile types are like ice cream\u2014 they come in all different kinds of flavors. In light of such variety, Section 3.2 \\n\"Data about Data\" details some of the key issues that need to be considered when acquiring and working \\nwith data and information for GISs. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Data refer to specific facts, measurements, or characteristics of objects and phenomena of interest.  \\n\u2022 Information refers to knowledge of value that is obtained from the analysis of data.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to highlight the difference between primary and secondary data sources \\nand to understand the importance of metadata and data standards.  \\nConsider the following comma-delimited file: \\ncity, sun, temp, precip \\nLos Angeles, 300, 70, 10 \\nLondon, 50, 55, 40 \\nSingapore, 330, 80, 60 \\nLooking at the contents of the file, we can see that it contains data about the cities of Los Angeles, \\nLondon, and Singapore. As noted, each field or attribute is separated by a comma, and the file also \\ncontains a header row that tells us about the data contained in each column. Or does it? What does \\nthe column \u201csun\u201d refer to? Is it the number of sunny days this year, last year, annually, or when? \\nWhat about \u201ctemp\u201d? Does this refer to the average daytime, evening, or annual temperature? For \\nthat matter, how is temperature measured? In Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin? The column \u201cprecip\u201d \\nprobably refers to precipitation, but again, what are the units or time frame for such measures and \\ndata? Finally, where did these data come from? Who collected them, when were they collected and \\nfor what purpose? \\nIt is amazing to think that such a small text file can lead to so many questions. Now let\u2019s extend the \\nexample to a file with one hundred records on ten variables, one thousand records on one hundred \\nvariables or better yet, ten thousand records on one thousand variables. Through this rather simple \\nexample, a number of general but central issues that are related to data emerge. Such issues range \\nfrom the relatively mundane naming conventions that are used to identify individual records (i.e., \\nrows) and distinguish one field (i.e., column) from another, to the issue of providing documentation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  68 \\nabout what data are included in a given file; when the data were collected; for what purpose are the \\ndata to be used; who collected them; and, of course, where did the data come from? \\nThe previous simple text file illustrates how we cannot and should not take data and information for \\ngranted. It also highlights two important concepts with regard to the source of data and to the \\ncontents of data files. With regard to data sources, data can be put into one of two distinct categories. \\nThe first category is called primary data. Primary data refer to data that are collected directly or on a \\nfirsthand basis. For example, if you wanted to examine the variability of local temperatures in the \\nmonth of May, and you recorded the temperature at noon every day in May, you would be \\nconstructing a primary data set. Conversely, secondary data refer to data collected by someone else or \\nsome other party. For instance, when we work with census or economic data collected and \\ndistributed by the government, we are using secondary data. \\nSeveral factors influence the decision behind the construction and use of primary data sets versus \\nsecondary data sets. Among the most important factors are the costs associated with data acquisition \\nin terms of money, availability, and time. In fact, the data acquisition and integration phase of most \\ngeographic information system (GIS) projects is often the most time consuming. In other words, \\nlocating, obtaining, and putting together the data to be used for a GIS project, whether you collect \\nthe data yourself or use secondary data, may indeed take up most of your time. Of course, depending \\non the purpose, availability, and need, it may not be necessary to construct an entirely new data set \\n(i.e., primary data set). In light of the vast amounts of data and information that are publicly \\navailable, for example, via the Internet, the cost and time savings of using secondary data often offset \\nany benefits that are associated with primary data collection. \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of the difference between primary and secondary data, as \\nwell as the rationale behind each, how do we go about finding the data and information that we \\nneed? As noted earlier, there is an incredibly vast and growing amount of data and information \\navailable to us, and performing an online search for \u201cdeforestation data\u201d will return hundreds\u2014 if not \\nthousands\u2014 of results. To overcome this data and information overload we need to turn to\u2026even \\nmore data. In particular, we are looking for a special kind of data called metadata. Simply defined, \\nmetadata are data about data. At one level, a header row in a simple text file like those discussed in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  69 \\nthe previous section is analogous to metadata. The header row provides data (e.g., names and labels) \\nabout the subsequent rows of data. \\nHeader rows themselves, however, may need additional explanation as previously illustrated. \\nFurthermore, when working with or searching through several data sets, it can be quite tedious at \\nbest or impossible at worst to open each and every file in order to determine its contents and \\nusability. Enter metadata. Today many files, and in particular secondary data sets, come with a \\nmetadata file. These metadata files contain items such as general descriptions about the contents of \\nthe file, definitions for the various terms used to identify records (rows) and fields (fields), the range \\nof values for fields, the quality or reliability of the data and measurements, how the data were \\ncollected, when the data were collected, and who collected the data. Though not all data are \\naccompanied by metadata, it is easy to see and understand why metadata are important and valuable \\nwhen searching for secondary data, as well as when constructing primary data that may be shared in \\nthe future. \\nJust as simple files come in all shapes, sizes, and formats, so too do metadata. As the amount and \\navailability of data and information increase each and every day, metadata play a critical role in \\nmaking sense of it all. The class of metadata that we are most concerned with when working with a \\nGIS is calledgeospatial metadata. As the name suggests, geospatial metadata are data about \\ngeographical and spatial data. According to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in the \\nUnited States (see http://www.fgdc.gov), \u201cGeospatial metadata are used to document geographic \\ndigital resources such as GIS files, geospatial databases, and earth imagery. A geospatial metadata \\nrecord includes core library catalog elements such as Title, Abstract, and Publication Data; \\ngeographic elements such as Geographic Extent and Projection Information; and database elements \\nsuch as Attribute Label Definitions and Attribute Domain Values.\u201d The definition of geospatial \\nmetadata is about improving transparency when it comes to data, as well as promoting standards. \\nTake a few moments to explore and examine the contents of a geospatial metadata file that conforms \\nto the FGDC here. \\nGenerally, standards refer to widely promoted, accepted, and followed rules and practices. Given the \\nrange and variability of data and data sources, identifying a common thread to locate and understand Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  70 \\nthe contents of any given file can be a challenge. Just as the rules of grammar and mathematics \\nprovide the foundations for communication and numeric calculations, respectively, metadata \\nprovide similar frameworks for working with and sharing data and information from various \\nsources. \\nThe central point behind metadata is that it facilitates data and information sharing. Within the \\ncontext of large organizations such as governments, data and information sharing can eliminate \\nredundancies and increase efficiencies. Moreover, access to data and information promotes the \\nintegration of different data that can improve analyses, inform decisions, and shape policy. The role \\nthat metadata\u2014 and in particular geospatial metadata\u2014 play in the world of GISs is critical and offers \\nenormous benefits in terms of cost and time savings. It is precisely the sharing, widespread \\ndistribution and integration of various geographic and nongeographic data and information, enabled \\nby metadata, that drive some of the most interesting and compelling innovations in GISs and the \\nbroader geospatial information technology community. More important, widespread access, \\ndistribution, and sharing of geographic data and information have important social costs and \\nbenefits and yield better analyses and more informed decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Primary data refer to data that are obtained via direct observation or measure, and secondary data refer \\nto data collected by a different party. \\n\u2022 Data acquisition is among the most time-consuming aspects of any GIS project. \\n\u2022 Metadata are data about data and promote data exchange, dissemination, and integration.  \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the costs and benefits of using primary data instead of secondary data?  \\n2. Refer to the Federal Geographic Data Committee website (http://www.fgdc.gov) and describe in detail \\nwhat information should be included in a metadata file. Why are metadata and standards important?  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  71 \\n3.3 Finding Data \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to identify and evaluate key considerations when searching for data.  \\nNow that we have a basic understanding of data and information, where can we find such data and \\ninformation? Though an Internet search will certainly come up with myriad sources and types of \\ndata, the hunt for relevant and useful data is often a challenging and iterative process. Therefore, \\nprior to hopping online and downloading the first thing that appears from a web search, it is useful \\nto frame our search for data with the following questions and considerations: \\n1. What exactly is the purpose of the data? Given the fact the world is swimming in va st amounts of \\ndata, articulating why we need (or why we don\u2019t need) a given set of data will streamline the \\nsearch for useful and relevant data. To this end, the more specific we can be about the purpose of \\nthe needed data, the more efficient our search for data will be. For example, if we are interested in \\nunderstanding and studying economic growth, it is useful to determine both temporal and \\ngeographic scales. In other words, for what time periods (e.g., 1850 \u20131900) and intervals (e.g., \\nquarterly, annually) are we interested, and at what level of analysis (e.g., national, regional, \\nstate)? Oftentimes, data availability, or more specifically, the lack of relevant data, will force us to \\nchange the purpose or scope of our original question. A clear purpose will yield a more efficient \\nsearch for data and enables us to accept or discard quickly the various data sets that we may come \\nacross. \\n2. The second question we need to ask ourselves is what data already exist and to what data do we \\nhave access already? Prior to searching for new data, it is always a good idea to take an inventory \\nof the data that we already have. Such data may be from previous projects or analyses, or from \\ncolleagues and classmates, but the key point here is that we can save a lot of time and ef fort by \\nusing data that we already possess. Furthermore, by identifying what we have, we get a better \\nunderstanding of what we need. For instance, though we may already have census data (i.e., \\nattribute data), we may need updated geographic data that conta ins the boundaries of US states \\nor counties. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  72 \\n3. Next, we need to assess and evaluate the costs associated with data acquisition. Data acquisition \\ncosts go beyond financial costs. Just as important as the financial costs to data are those that \\ninvolve your time. After all, time is money. The time and energy you spend on collecting, finding, \\ncleaning, and formatting data are time and energy taken away from data analysis. Depending on \\ndeadlines, time constraints, and deliverables, it is critical to learn how to m anage your time when \\nlooking for data. \\n4. Finally, the format of the data that is needed is of critical importance. Though many programs can \\nread many formats of data, there are some data types that can only be read by some programs and \\nsome programs that require particular data formats. Understanding what data formats you can \\nuse and those that you cannot will aid in your search for data. For instance, one of the most \\ncommon forms of geographic information system (GIS) data is called the  shapefile. Not all GIS \\nprograms can read or use shapefiles, but it may be necessary to convert to or from a shapefile or \\nsome other format. Hence, as noted earlier, the more data formats with which we are familiar, the \\nbetter off we will be in our search for data because we will have an understanding of not only what \\nwe can use but also what format conversions will need to be made if necessary.  \\nAll these questions are of equal importance and being able to answer them will assist in a more \\nefficient and effective search for data. Obviously, there are several other considerations behind the \\nsearch for data, and in particular GIS data, but those listed here provide an initial pathway to a \\nsuccessful search for data. \\nAs information technology evolves, and as more and more data are collected and distributed, the \\nvarious forms of data that can be used with a GIS increases. Generally, and as discussed previously, a \\nGIS uses and integrates two types of data: geographic data and attribute data. Sometimes the source \\nof both geographic and attribute data are one in the same. For instance, the US Bureau of Census \\n(http://www.census.gov) distributes geographic boundary files (e.g., census tract level, county level, \\nstate level) as well as the associated attribute data (e.g., population, race/ethnicity, income). What\u2019s \\nmore is that such data are freely available at no charge. In many respects, US census data are \\nexceptional: they are free and comprehensive. If only all data were free and comprehensive! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  73 \\nObviously, each and every search for data will vary according to purpose, but data from governments \\ntend to have good coverage and provide a point of reference from which other data can be added, \\ncompared, and evaluated. Whether you need satellite imagery data from the National Aeronautics \\nand Space Administration (http://www.nasa.gov) or land use data from the United States Geological \\nSurvey (http://www.usgs.gov), such government sources tend to be reliable, reputable, and \\nconsistent. Another key element of most government data is that they are freely accessible to the \\npublic. In other words, there is no charge to use or to acquire the data. Data that are free to use are \\ngenerally called public data. \\nUnlike publicly available data, there are numerous sources of private or proprietary data. The main \\ndifference between public and private data is that the former tend to be free, and the latter must be \\nacquired at a cost. Furthermore, there are often restrictions on the redistribution and dissemination \\nof proprietary data sets (i.e., sharing the purchased data is not allowed). Again, depending on the \\nsubject matter, proprietary data may be the only option. Another reason for using proprietary data is \\nthat the data may be formatted and cleaned according to your needs. The trade-off between financial \\ncost and time saved is one that must be seriously considered and evaluated when working with \\ndeadlines. \\nThe search for data, and in particular the data that you need, is often the most time consuming \\naspect of any GIS-related project. Therefore, it is critical to try to define and clarify your data \\nrequirements and needs\u2014 from the temporal and geographic scales of data to the formats required\u2014\\nas clearly as possible and as early as possible. Such definition and clarity will pay dividends in your \\nsearch for the right data, which in turn will yield better analyses and well-informed decisions. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n\u2022 Prior to searching for data, ask yourself the following questions: Why do I need the data? At what time \\nscale do I need the data? At what geographic scale do I want the data? What data already exist? What \\nformat do I need the data? \\n \\nEXERCISES  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  74 \\n1.

Data models are a set of rules and/or constructs used to describe and represent aspects of the \\nreal world in a computer. Two primary data models are available to complete this task: raster data \\nmodels and vector data models. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  76 \\n4.1 Raster Data Models \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to understand how raster data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nThe raster data model is widely used in applications ranging far beyond geographic information \\nsystems (GISs). Most likely, you are already very familiar with this data model if you have any \\nexperience with digital photographs. The ubiquitous JPEG, BMP, and TIFF file formats (among \\nothers) are based on the raster data model (see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section \\n5.3 \"File Formats\"). Take a moment to view your favorite digital image. If you zoom deeply into the \\nimage, you will notice that it is composed of an array of tiny square pixels (or picture elements). Each \\nof these uniquely colored pixels, when viewed as a whole, combines to form a coherent image (Figure \\n4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nFigure 4.1 Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image \\n \\nFurthermore, all liquid crystal display (LCD) computer monitors are based on raster technology as \\nthey are composed of a set number of rows and columns of pixels. Notably, the foundation of this \\ntechnology predates computers and digital cameras by nearly a century. The neoimpressionist artist, \\nGeorges Seurat, developed a painting technique referred to as \u201cpointillism\u201d in the 1880s, which \\nsimilarly relies on the amassing of small, monochromatic \u201cdots\u201d of ink that combine to form a larger \\nimage (Figure 4.2 \"Pointillist Artwork\"). If you are as generous as the author, you may indeed think \\nof your raster dataset creations as sublime works of art. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  77 \\nFigure 4.2 Pointillist Artwork \\n \\nThe raster data model consists of rows and columns of equally sized pixels interconnected to form a \\nplanar surface. These pixels are used as building blocks for creating points, lines, areas, networks, \\nand surfaces (Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Figure 2.6 \"Map Overlay Process\" illustrates how a land \\nparcel can be converted to a raster representation). Although pixels may be triangles, hexagons, or \\neven octagons, square pixels represent the simplest geometric form with which to work. Accordingly, \\nthe vast majority of available raster GIS data are built on the square pixel (Figure 4.3 \"Common \\nRaster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and USGS DEM (right)\"). These \\nsquares are typically reformed into rectangles of various dimensions if the data model is transformed \\nfrom one projection to another (e.g., from State Plane coordinates to UTM [Universal Transverse \\nMercator] coordinates). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  78 \\nFigure 4.3 Common Raster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and \\nUSGS DEM (right) \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nBecause of the reliance on a uniform series of square pixels, the raster data model is referred to as a \\ngrid-based system. Typically, a single data value will be assigned to each grid locale. Each cell in a \\nraster carries a single value, which represents the characteristic of the spatial phenomenon at a \\nlocation denoted by its row and column. The data type for that cell value can be either integer or \\nfloating-point (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1 \"Geographic Data \\nAcquisition\"). Alternatively, the raster graphic can reference a database management system wherein \\nopen-ended attribute tables can be used to associate multiple data values to each pixel. The advance \\nof computer technology has made this second methodology increasingly feasible as large datasets are \\nno longer constrained by computer storage issues as they were previously. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  79 \\nThe raster model will average all values within a given pixel to yield a single value. Therefore, the \\nmore area covered per pixel, the less accurate the associated data values. The area covered by each \\npixel determines thespatial resolution of the raster model from which it is derived. Specifically, \\nresolution is determined by measuring one side of the square pixel. A raster model with pixels \\nrepresenting 10 m by 10 m (or 100 square meters) in the real world would be said to have a spatial \\nresolution of 10 m; a raster model with pixels measuring 1 km by 1 km (1 square kilometer) in the \\nreal world would be said to have a spatial resolution of 1 km; and so forth. \\nCare must be taken when determining the resolution of a raster because using an overly coarse pixel \\nresolution will cause a loss of information, whereas using overly fine pixel resolution will result in \\nsignificant increases in file size and computer processing requirements during display and/or \\nanalysis. An effective pixel resolution will take both the map scale and the minimum mapping unit of \\nthe other GIS data into consideration. In the case of raster graphics with coarse spatial resolution, \\nthe data values associated with specific locations are not necessarily explicit in the raster data model. \\nFor example, if the location of telephone poles were mapped on a coarse raster graphic, it would be \\nclear that the entire cell would not be filled by the pole. Rather, the pole would be assumed to be \\nlocated somewhere within that cell (typically at the center). \\nImagery employing the raster data model must exhibit several properties. First, each pixel must hold \\nat least one value, even if that data value is zero. Furthermore, if no data are present for a given pixel, \\na data value placeholder must be assigned to this grid cell. Often, an arbitrary, readily identifiable \\nvalue (e.g., \u22129999) will be assigned to pixels for which there is no data value. Second, a cell can hold \\nany alphanumeric index that represents an attribute. In the case of quantitative datasets, attribute \\nassignation is fairly straightforward. For example, if a raster image denotes elevation, the data values \\nfor each pixel would be some indication of elevation, usually in feet or meters. In the case of \\nqualitative datasets, data values are indices that necessarily refer to some predetermined \\ntranslational rule. In the case of a land-use/land-cover raster graphic, the following rule may be \\napplied: 1 = grassland, 2 = agricultural, 3 = disturbed, and so forth (Figure 4.4 \"Land-Use/Land-\\nCover Raster Image\"). The third property of the raster data model is that points and lines \u201cmove\u201d to \\nthe center of the cell. As one might expect, if a 1 km resolution raster image contains a river or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  80 \\nstream, the location of the actual waterway within the \u201criver\u201d pixel will be unclear. Therefore, there is \\na general assumption that all zero-dimensional (point) and one-dimensional (line) features will be \\nlocated toward the center of the cell. As a corollary, the minimum width for any line feature must \\nnecessarily be one cell regardless of the actual width of the feature. If it is not, the feature will not be \\nrepresented in the image and will therefore be assumed to be absent. \\nFigure 4.4 Land-Use/Land-Cover Raster Image \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  81 \\nSeveral methods exist for encoding raster data from scratch. Three of these models are as follows: \\n1. Cell-by-cell raster encoding. This minimally intensive method encodes a raster by creating \\nrecords for each cell value by row and column (Figure 4.5 \"Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThis method could be thought of as a large spreadsheet wherein each cell of the spreadsheet \\nrepresents a pixel in the raster image. This method is also referred to as \u201cexhaustive \\nenumeration.\u201d \\n2. Run-length raster encoding. This method encodes cell values in runs of similarly valued pixels \\nand can result in a highly compressed image file (Figure 4.6 \"Run-Length Encoding of Raster \\nData\"). The run-length encoding method is useful in situations where large groups of neighboring \\npixels have similar values (e.g., discrete datasets such as land use/land cover or habitat \\nsuitability) and is less useful where neighboring pixel values vary widely (e.g., continuous datasets \\nsuch as elevation or sea-surface temperatures). \\n3. Quad-tree raster encoding. This method divides a raster into a hierarchy of quadrants that are \\nsubdivided based on similarly valued pixels (Figure 4.7 \"Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data\"). \\nThe division of the raster stops when a quadrant is made entirely from cells of the same value. A \\nquadrant that cannot be subdivided is called a \u201cleaf node.\u201d \\nFigure 4.5 Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  82 \\nFigure 4.6 Run-Length Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  83 \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Raster Model \\nThe use of a raster data model confers many advantages. First, the technology required to create raster \\ngraphics is inexpensive and ubiquitous. Nearly everyone currently owns some sort of raster image \\ngenerator, namely a digital camera, and few cellular phones are sold today that don\u2019t include such \\nfunctionality. Similarly, a plethora of satellites are constantly beaming up -to-the-minute raster graphics \\nto scientific facilities across the globe (Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3 \"File \\nFormats\"). These graphics are often posted online for private and/or public use, occasionally at no cost to \\nthe user. \\nAdditional advantages of raster graphics are the relative simplicity of the underlying data structure. Each \\ngrid location represented in the raster image correlates to a single value (or series of values if attributes \\ntables are included). This simple data structure may also help explain why it is relatively easy to perform \\noverlay analyses on raster data (for more on overlay analyses, see Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector \\nOperations\", Section 7.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\"). This simplicity also lends itself to easy interpretation \\nand maintenance of the graphics, relative to its vector counterpart.  \\nDespite the advantages, there are also several disadvantages to using the raster data model. The first \\ndisadvantage is that raster files are typically very large. Particu larly in the case of raster images built from \\nthe cell-by-cell encoding methodology, the sheer number of values stored for a given dataset result in \\npotentially enormous files. Any raster file that covers a large area and has somewhat finely resolved pixel s \\nwill quickly reach hundreds of megabytes in size or more. These large files are only getting larger as the \\nquantity and quality of raster datasets continues to keep pace with quantity and quality of computer \\nresources and raster data collectors (e.g., digital cameras, satellites). \\nA second disadvantage of the raster model is that the output images are less \u201cpretty\u201d than their vector \\ncounterparts. This is particularly noticeable when the raster images are enlarged or zoomed (refer \\nto Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\" ). Depending on how \\nfar one zooms into a raster image, the details and coherence of that image will quickly be lost amid a \\npixilated sea of seemingly randomly colored grid cells. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  84 \\nThe geometric transformations that arise during map reprojection efforts can cause problems for raster \\ngraphics and represent a third disadvantage to using the raster data model. As described in  Chapter 2 \\n\"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.2 \"Map Scale, Coordinate Systems, and Map Projections\", changing map \\nprojections will alter the size and shape of the original input layer and frequently result in the loss or \\naddition of pixels (White 2006). [1] These alterations will result in the perfect square pixels of the input \\nlayer taking on some alternate rhomboidal dimensions. However, the problem is larger than a simple \\nreformation of the square pixel. Indeed, the reprojection of a raster image dataset from one projection to \\nanother brings change to pixel values that may, in turn, significantly alter the output information (Seong \\n2003). [2] \\nThe final disadvantage of using the raster data model is that it is not suitable for some types of spatial \\nanalyses. For example, difficulties arise when attempting to overlay and analyze multiple raster  graphics \\nproduced at differing scales and pixel resolutions. Combining information from a raster image with 10 m \\nspatial resolution with a raster image with 1 km spatial resolution will most likely produce nonsensical \\noutput information as the scales of analysis are far too disparate to result in meaningful and/or \\ninterpretable conclusions. In addition, some network and spatial analyses (i.e., determining directionality \\nor geocoding) can be problematic to perform on raster data. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Raster data are derived from a grid-based system of contiguous cells containing specific attribute \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The spatial resolution of a raster dataset represents a measure of the accuracy or detail of the displayed \\ninformation. \\n\u2022 The raster data model is widely used by non-GIS technologies such as digital cameras/pictures and LCD \\nmonitors. \\n\u2022 Care should be taken to determine whether the raster or vector data model is best suited for your data \\nand/or analytical needs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how vector data models are implemented in GIS \\napplications. \\nIn contrast to the raster data model is the vector data model. In this model, space is not quantized \\ninto discrete grid cells like the raster model. Vector data models use points and their associated X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs to represent the vertices of spatial features, much as if they were being drawn on a \\nmap by hand (Aronoff 1989). [1] The data attributes of these features are then stored in a separate \\ndatabase management system. The spatial information and the attribute information for these \\nmodels are linked via a simple identification number that is given to each feature in a map. \\nThree fundamental vector types exist in geographic information systems (GISs): points, lines, and \\npolygons (Figure 4.8 \"Points, Lines, and Polygons\"). Points are zero-dimensional objects that contain \\nonly a single coordinate pair. Points are typically used to model singular, discrete features such as \\nbuildings, wells, power poles, sample locations, and so forth. Points have only the property of \\nlocation. Other types of point features include the node and the vertex. Specifically, a point is a stand-\\nalone feature, while a node is a topological junction representing a common X, Y coordinate pair \\nbetween intersecting lines and/or polygons. Vertices are defined as each bend along a line or polygon \\nfeature that is not the intersection of lines or polygons. \\nFigure 4.8 Points, Lines, and Polygons \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  87 \\nPoints can be spatially linked to form more complex features. Lines are one-dimensional features \\ncomposed of multiple, explicitly connected points. Lines are used to represent linear features such as \\nroads, streams, faults, boundaries, and so forth. Lines have the property of length. Lines that directly \\nconnect two nodes are sometimes referred to as chains, edges, segments, or arcs. \\nPolygons are two-dimensional features created by multiple lines that loop back to create a \u201cclosed\u201d \\nfeature. In the case of polygons, the first coordinate pair (point) on the first line segment is the same \\nas the last coordinate pair on the last line segment. Polygons are used to represent features such as \\ncity boundaries, geologic formations, lakes, soil associations, vegetation communities, and so forth. \\nPolygons have the properties of area and perimeter. Polygons are also called areas. \\nVector Data Models Structures \\nVector data models can be structured many different ways. We will examine two of the more common \\ndata structures here. The simplest vector data structure is called the spaghetti data model (Dangermond \\n1982). [2] In the spaghetti model, each point, line, and/or polygon feature is represented as a string of X, Y \\ncoordinate pairs (or as a single X, Y coordinate pair in the case of a vector image with a single point) with \\nno inherent structure (Figure 4.9 \"Spaghetti Data Model\"). One could envision each line in this model to \\nbe a single strand of spaghetti that is formed into complex shapes by the addition of more and more \\nstrands of spaghetti. It is notable that in this model, any polygons that lie adjacent to each other must be \\nmade up of their own lines, or stands of spaghetti. In other words, each polygon must be uniquely defined \\nby its own set of X, Y coordinate pairs, even if the adjacent polygons share the exact same boundary \\ninformation. This creates some redundancies within the data model and therefore reduces efficiency. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  88 \\nFigure 4.9 Spaghetti Data Model \\n \\nDespite the location designations associated with each line, or strand of spaghetti, spatial relationships \\nare not explicitly encoded within the spaghetti model; rather, they are  implied by their location. This \\nresults in a lack of topological information, which is problematic if the user attempts to make \\nmeasurements or analysis. The computational requirements, therefore, are very steep if any advanced \\nanalytical techniques are employed on vector files structured thusly. Nevertheless, the simple structure of \\nthe spaghetti data model allows for efficient reproduction of maps and graphics as this topological \\ninformation is unnecessary for plotting and printing. \\nIn contrast to the spaghetti data model, the topological data model is characterized by the inclusion of \\ntopological information within the dataset, as the name implies. Topology is a set of rules that model the \\nrelationships between neighboring points, lines, and polygons and determines how they share geometry. \\nFor example, consider two adjacent polygons. In the spaghetti model, the shared boundary of two \\nneighboring polygons is defined as two separate, identical lines. The inclusion of topology into the data \\nmodel allows for a single line to represent this shared boundary with an explicit reference to denote which \\nside of the line belongs with which polygon. Topology is also concerned with preserving spatial properties \\nwhen the forms are bent, stretched, or placed under similar geometric transformations, which allows for \\nmore efficient projection and reprojection of map files. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  89 \\nThree basic topological precepts that are necessary to understand the topological data model are outlined \\nhere. First, connectivity describes the arc-node topology for the feature dataset. As discussed previously, \\nnodes are more than simple points. In the topological data model, nodes are the intersection points where \\ntwo or more arcs meet. In the case of arc-node topology, arcs have both a from-node (i.e., starting node) \\nindicating where the arc begins and a to-node (i.e., ending node) indicating where the arc ends (Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\"). In addition, between each node pair is a line segment, sometimes called a \\nlink, which has its own identification number and references both its from-node and to-node. In Figure \\n4.10 \"Arc-Node Topology\", arcs 1, 2, and 3 all intersect because they share node 11. Therefore, the \\ncomputer can determine that it is possible to move along arc 1 and turn onto arc 3, whi le it is not possible \\nto move from arc 1 to arc 5, as they do not share a common node. \\nFigure 4.10 Arc-Node Topology \\n \\nThe second basic topological precept is area definition. Area definition states that an arc that connects to \\nsurround an area defines a polygon, also called polygon-arc topology. In the case of polygon-arc topology, \\narcs are used to construct polygons, and each arc is stored only once (Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc \\nTopology\"). This results in a reduction in the amount of data stored and ensures  that adjacent polygon \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  90 \\nboundaries do not overlap. In the Figure 4.11 \"Polygon-Arc Topology\", the polygon-arc topology makes it \\nclear that polygon F is made up of arcs 8, 9, and 10. \\nFigure 4.11 Polygon-Arc Topology \\n \\nContiguity, the third topological precept, is based on the concept that polygons that share a boundary are \\ndeemed adjacent. Specifically, polygon topology requires that all arcs in a polygon have a direction (a \\nfrom-node and a to-node), which allows adjacency information to be determined (Figure 4.12 \"Polygon \\nTopology\"). Polygons that share an arc are deemed adjacent, or contiguous, and therefore the \u201cleft\u201d and \\n\u201cright\u201d side of each arc can be defined. This left and right polygon information is stored explicitly within \\nthe attribute information of the topological data model. The \u201cuniverse polygon\u201d is an essential component \\nof polygon topology that represents the external area located outside of the study area.  Figure 4.12 \\n\"Polygon Topology\" shows that arc 6 is bound on the left by polygon B and to the right by polygon C. \\nPolygon A, the universe polygon, is to the left of arcs 1, 2, and 3.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  91 \\nFigure 4.12 Polygon Topology \\n \\nTopology allows the computer to rapidly determine and analyze the spatial relationships of all its included \\nfeatures. In addition, topological information is important because it allows for efficient error detection \\nwithin a vector dataset. In the case of polygon features, open or unclosed polygons, which occur when an \\narc does not completely loop back upon itself, and unlabeled polygons, which occur when an area does not \\ncontain any attribute information, violate polygon-arc topology rules. Another topological error found \\nwith polygon features is the sliver. Slivers occur when the shared boundary of two polygons do not meet \\nexactly (Figure 4.13 \"Common Topological Errors\"). \\nIn the case of line features, topological errors occur when two lines do not meet perfectly at a node. This \\nerror is called an \u201cundershoot\u201d when the lines do not extend far enough to meet each other and an \\n\u201covershoot\u201d when the line extends beyond the feature it should connect to (Figure 4.13 \"Common \\nTopological Errors\"). The result of overshoots and undershoots is a \u201cdangling node\u201d at the end of the line. \\nDangling nodes aren\u2019t always an error, however, as they occur in the case of dead-end streets on a road \\nmap. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  92 \\nFigure 4.13 Common Topological Errors \\n \\nMany types of spatial analysis require the degree of organization offered by topologically explicit data \\nmodels. In particular, network analysis (e.g., finding the best route from one location to another) and \\nmeasurement (e.g., finding the length of a river segment) relies heavily on the concept of to - and from-\\nnodes and uses this information, along with attribute information, to calculate distances, shortest rou tes, \\nquickest routes, and so forth. Topology also allows for sophisticated neighborhood analysis such as \\ndetermining adjacency, clustering, nearest neighbors, and so forth. \\nNow that the basics of the concepts of topology have been outlined, we can begin to  better understand the \\ntopological data model. In this model, the node acts as more than just a simple point along a line or \\npolygon. The node represents the point of intersection for two or more arcs. Arcs may or may not be \\nlooped into polygons. Regardless, all nodes, arcs, and polygons are individually numbered. This \\nnumbering allows for quick and easy reference within the data model.  \\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of the Vector Model \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  93 \\nIn comparison with the raster data model, vector data models tend to be better representations of reality \\ndue to the accuracy and precision of points, lines, and polygons over the regularly spaced grid cells of the \\nraster model. This results in vector data tending to be more aesthetically pleasing than raster data. \\nVector data also provides an increased ability to alter the scale of observation and analysis. As each \\ncoordinate pair associated with a point, line, and polygon represents an infinitesimally exact location \\n(albeit limited by the number of significant digits and/or data acquisition methodologies), zooming deep \\ninto a vector image does not change the view of a vector graphic in the way that it does a raster graphic \\n(see Figure 4.1 \"Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image\"). \\nVector data tend to be more compact in data structure, so file sizes are typically much smaller than their \\nraster counterparts. Although the ability of modern computers has minimized the importance of \\nmaintaining small file sizes, vector data often require a fraction the computer storage space when \\ncompared to raster data. \\nThe final advantage of vector data is that topology is inherent in the vector model. This topological \\ninformation results in simplified spatial analysis (e.g., error detection, network analysis, proximity \\nanalysis, and spatial transformation) when using a vector model. \\nAlternatively, there are two primary disadvantages of the vector data model. First, the data structure \\ntends to be much more complex than the simple raster data model. As the location of each vertex must be \\nstored explicitly in the model, there are no shortcuts for storing data like there are for raster models (e.g., \\nthe run-length and quad-tree encoding methodologies). \\nSecond, the implementation of spatial analysis can also be relatively complicated due to minor differences \\nin accuracy and precision between the input datasets. Similarly, the algorithms for manipulating and \\nanalyzing vector data are complex and can lead to intensive processing  requirements, particularly when \\ndealing with large datasets. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector data utilizes points, lines, and polygons to represent the spatial features in a map.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  94 \\n\u2022 Topology is an informative geospatial property that describes the connectivity, area definition, and \\ncontiguity of interrelated points, lines, and polygon. \\n\u2022 Vector data may or may not be topologically explicit, depending on the file\u2019s data structure.  \\n\u2022 Care should be taken to determine whether the raster or vector data model is best suited for  your data \\nand/or analytical needs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how satellite imagery and aerial photography are \\nimplemented in GIS applications. \\nA wide variety of satellite imagery and aerial photography is available for use in geographic \\ninformation systems (GISs). Although these products are basically raster graphics, they are \\nsubstantively different in their usage within a GIS. Satellite imagery and aerial photography provide \\nimportant contextual information for a GIS and are often used to conduct heads-up digitizing \\n(Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.1.4 \"Secondary Data Capture\") whereby \\nfeatures from the image are converted into vector datasets. \\nSatellite Imagery \\nRemotely sensed satellite imagery is becoming increasingly common as satellites equipped with \\ntechnologically advanced sensors are continually being sent into space by pu blic agencies and private \\ncompanies around the globe. Satellites are used for applications such as military and civilian earth \\nobservation, communication, navigation, weather, research, and more. Currently, more than 3,000 \\nsatellites have been sent to space, with over 2,500 of them originating from Russia and the United States. \\nThese satellites maintain different altitudes, inclinations, eccentricities, synchronies, and orbital centers, \\nallowing them to image a wide variety of surface features and processes  (Figure 4.14 \"Satellites Orbiting \\nthe Earth\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  96 \\nFigure 4.14 Satellites Orbiting the Earth \\n \\nSatellites can be active or passive. Active satellites make use of remote sensors that detect reflected \\nresponses from objects that are irradiated from artificially generated energy sources. For example, active \\nsensors such as radars emit radio waves, laser sensors emit light waves, and sonar sensors emit sound \\nwaves. In all cases, the sensor emits the signal and then calculates the time it takes for the returned signal \\nto \u201cbounce\u201d back from some remote feature. Knowing the speed of the emitted signal, the time delay from \\nthe original emission to the return can be used to calculate the distance to the feature.  \\nPassive satellites, alternatively, make use of sensors that detect the reflected or emitted electromagnetic \\nradiation from natural sources. This natural source is typically the energy from the sun, but other sources \\ncan be imaged as well, such as magnetism and geothermal activity. Using an example we\u2019ve all \\nexperienced, taking a picture with a flash-enabled camera would be active remote sensing, while using a \\ncamera without a flash (i.e., relying on ambient light to illuminate the scene) would be passive remote \\nsensing. \\nThe quality and quantity of satellite imagery is largely determined by their resolution. There are four types \\nof resolution that characterize any particular remote sensor (Campbell 2002).  [1] The spatial resolution of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  97 \\na satellite image, as described previously in the raster data model se ction (Section 4.1 \"Raster Data \\nModels\"), is a direct representation of the ground coverage for each pixel shown in the image. If a satellite \\nproduces imagery with a 10 m resolution, the corresponding ground coverage for each of those pixels is 10 \\nm by 10 m, or 100 square meters on the ground. Spatial resolution is determined by the sensors\u2019 \\ninstantaneous field of view (IFOV). The IFOV is essentially the ground area through which the sensor is \\nreceiving the electromagnetic radiation signal and is determined by height and angle of the imaging \\nplatform. \\nSpectral resolution denotes the ability of the sensor to resolve wavelength intervals, also called bands, \\nwithin the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral resolution is determined by the interval size of the \\nwavelengths and the number of intervals being scanned. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are \\nthose sensors that can resolve a multitude of wavelengths intervals within the spectrum. For example, the \\nIKONOS satellite resolves images for bands at the blue (445\u2013516 nm), green (506\u201395 nm), red (632\u201398 \\nnm), and near-infrared (757\u2013853 nm) wavelength intervals on its 4-meter multispectral sensor. \\nTemporal resolution is the amount of time between each image collection period and is determined by the \\nrepeat cycle of the satellite\u2019s orbit. Temporal resolution can be thought of as true-nadir or off-nadir. Areas \\nconsidered true-nadir are those located directly beneath the sensor while off-nadir areas are those that are \\nimaged obliquely. In the case of the IKONOS satellite, the temporal resolution is 3 to 5 days for off-nadir \\nimaging and 144 days for true-nadir imaging. \\nThe fourth and final type of resolution, radiometric resolution, refers to the sensitivity of the sensor to \\nvariations in brightness and specifically denotes the number of grayscale levels that can be imaged by the \\nsensor. Typically, the available radiometric values for a sensor are 8-bit (yielding values that range from \\n0\u2013255 as 256 unique values or as 28 values); 11-bit (0\u20132,047); 12-bit (0\u20134,095); or 16-bit (0\u201363,535) \\n(see Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\",Section 5.1.1 \"Data Types\" for more on bits). Landsat-7, for \\nexample, maintains 8-bit resolution for its bands and can therefore record values for each pixel that range \\nfrom 0 to 255. \\nBecause of the technical constraints associated with satellite remote sensing systems, there is a trade -off \\nbetween these different types of resolution. Improving one type of resolution often necessitates a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  98 \\nreduction in one of the other types of resolution. For example, an increase in spatial resolution is typically \\nassociated with a decrease in spectral resolution, and vice versa. Similarly,  geostationary satellites (those \\nthat circle the earth proximal to the equator once each day) yield high temporal resolution but low spatial \\nresolution, while sun-synchronous satellites (those that synchronize a near-polar orbit of the sensor with \\nthe sun\u2019s illumination) yield low temporal resolution while providing high spatial resolution. Although \\ntechnological advances can generally improve the various resolutions of an image, care must always be \\ntaken to ensure that the imagery you have chosen is adequate to the represent or model the geospatial \\nfeatures that are most important to your study. \\nAerial Photography \\nAerial photography, like satellite imagery, represents a vast source of information for use in any GIS. \\nPlatforms for the hardware used to take aerial photographs include airplanes, helicopters, balloons, \\nrockets, and so forth. While aerial photography connotes images taken of the visible spectrum, sensors to \\nmeasure bands within the nonvisible spectrum (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared, near -infrared) can also be fixed \\nto aerial sources. Similarly, aerial photography can be active or passive and can be taken from vert ical or \\noblique angles. Care must be taken with aerial photographs as the sensors used to take the images are \\nsimilar to cameras in their use of lenses. These lenses add a curvature to the images, which becomes more \\npronounced as one moves away from the center of the photo (Figure 4.15 \"Curvature Error Due to \\nLenticular Properties of Camera\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  99 \\nFigure 4.15 Curvature Error Due to Lenticular Properties of Camera \\n \\nAnother source of potential error in an aerial photograph is relief displacement. This error arises from the \\nthree-dimensional aspect of terrain features and is seen as apparent leaning away of vertical objects from \\nthe center point of an aerial photograph. To imagine this type of error, consider that a smokestack would \\nlook like a doughnut if the viewing camera was directly above the feature. However, if this same \\nsmokestack was observed near the edge of the camera\u2019s view, one could observe the sides of the \\nsmokestack. This error is frequently seen with trees and multistory buildings and worsens w ith \\nincreasingly taller features. \\nOrthophotos are vertical photographs that have been geometrically \u201ccorrected\u201d to remove the curvature \\nand terrain-induced error from images (Figure 4.16 \"Orthophoto\"). The most common orthophoto \\nproduct is the digital ortho quarter quadrangle (DOQQ). DOQQs are available through the US Geological \\nSurvey (USGS), who began producing these images from their library of 1:40,000- scale National Aerial \\nPhotography Program photos. These images can be obtained in either grayscale or color with 1-meter \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  100 \\nspatial resolution and 8-bit radiometric resolution. As the name suggests, these images cover a quarter of \\na USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, which equals an approximately 25 square mile area. Included with these \\nphotos is an additional 50 to 300-meter edge around the photo that allows users to mosaic many DOQQs \\ninto a single, continuous image. These DOQQs are ideal for use in a GIS as background display \\ninformation, for data editing, and for heads-up digitizing. \\nFigure 4.16 Orthophoto \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  101 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery is a common tool for GIS mapping applications as this data becomes increasingly \\navailable due to ongoing technological advances. \\n\u2022 Satellite imagery can be passive or active. \\n\u2022 The four types of resolution associated with satellite imagery are spatial, spectral, temporal, and \\nradiometric. \\n\u2022 Vertical and oblique aerial photographs provide valuable baseline informati on for GIS applications. \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

This \\nchapter addresses the basic concerns related to data acquisition and management of the various \\nformats and qualities of geospatial data currently available for use in modern geographic information \\nsystem (GIS) projects. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  103 \\n5.1 Geographic Data Acquisition \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to introduce different data types, measurement scales, and data capture \\nmethods. \\nAcquiring geographic data is an important factor in any geographic information system (GIS) effort. \\nIt has been estimated that data acquisition typically consumes 60 to 80 percent of the time and \\nmoney spent on any given project. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that GIS projects remain \\nmindful of their stated goals so the collection of spatial data proceeds in an efficient and effective \\nmanner as possible. This chapter outlines the many forms and sources of geospatial data available \\nfor use in a GIS. \\nData Types \\nThe type of data that we employ to help us understand a given entity is determined by (1) what we are \\nexamining, (2) what we want to know about that entity, and (3) our ability to measure that entity at a \\ndesired scale. The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, \\nnumbers, Boolean values, dates, and binaries. \\nAn alphanumeric string, or text, data type is any simple combination of letters and numbers that may or \\nmay not form coherent words. The number data type can be subcategorized as either floating-point or \\ninteger. A floating-point is any data value that contains decimal digits, while an integer is any data value \\nthat does not contain decimal digits. Integers can be short or long depending on the amount of significant \\ndigits in that number. Also, they are based on the concept of the \u201cbit\u201d in a computer. As you may recall, a \\nbit is the most basic unit of information in a computer and stores values in one of two states: 1 or 0. \\nTherefore, an 8-bit attribute would consist of eight 1s or 0s in any combination (e.g., 10010011, 00011011, \\n11100111). \\nShort integers are 16-bit values and therefore can be used to characterize numbers ranging either from \\n\u221232,768 to 32,767 or from 0 to 65,535 depending on whether the number is signed or unsigned (i.e., Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  104 \\ncontains a + or \u2212 sign).Long integers, alternatively, are 32-bit values and therefore can characterize \\nnumbers ranging either from \u22122,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or from 0 to 4,294,967,295.  \\nA single precision floating-point value occupies 32 bits, like the long integer. However, this data type \\nprovides for a value of up to 7 bits to the left of the decimal (a maxi mum value of 128, or 127 if signed) and \\nup to 23-bit values to the right of the decimal point (approximately 7 decimal digits). A \\ndouble precision floating-point value essentially stores two 32-bit values as a single value. Double \\nprecision floats, then, can represent a value with up to 11 bits to the left of the decimal point and values \\nwith up to 52 bits to the right of the decimal (approximately 16 decimal digits) ( Figure 5.1 \"Double \\nPrecision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer\"). \\nFigure 5.1 Double Precision Floating-Point (64-Bit Value), as Stored in a Computer \\n \\nBoolean, date, and binary values are less complex. Boolean values are simply those values that are deemed \\ntrue or false based on the application of a Boolean operator such  as AND, OR, and NOT. The date data \\ntype is presumably self-explanatory, while the binary data type represents attributes whose values are \\neither 1 or 0. \\nMeasurement Scale \\nIn addition to defining data by type, a measurement scale acts to group data accordi ng to level of \\ncomplexity (Stevens 1946). [1] For the purposes of GIS analyses, measurement scales can be grouped in to \\ntwo general categories. Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data; interval and ratio data \\nrepresent numeric data. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  105 \\nThe most simple data measurement scale is the nominal, or named, scale. The nominal scale makes \\nstatements about what to call data points but does not allow for scalar comparisons between one object \\nand another. For example, the attribution of nominal information to a set of points that represent cities \\nwill describe whether the given locale is \u201cLos Angeles\u201d or \u201cNew York.\u201d However, no further denotations, \\nsuch as population or voting history, can be made about those locales. Other examples of nominal data \\ninclude last name, eye color, land-use type, ethnicity, and gender. \\nOrdinal data places attribute information into ranks and therefore yields more precisely scaled \\ninformation than nominal data. Ordinal data describes the position in which data occur, such as first,  \\nsecond, third, and so forth. These scales may also take on names, such as \u201cvery unsatisfied,\u201d \u201cunsatisfied,\u201d \\n\u201csatisfied,\u201d and \u201cvery satisfied.\u201d Although this measurement scale indicates the ranking of each data point \\nrelative to other data points, the ordinal scale does not explicitly denote the exact quantitative difference \\nbetween these rankings. For example, if an ordinal attribute represents which runner came in first, \\nsecond, or third place, it does not state by how much time the winning runner beat the second place \\nrunner. Therefore, one cannot undertake arithmetic operations with ordinal data. Only sequence is \\nexplicit. \\nA measurement scale that does allow precise quantitative statements to be made about attributes \\nis interval data. Interval data are measured along a scale in which each position is equidistant to one \\nanother. Elevation and temperature readings are common representations of interval data. For example, \\nit can be determined through this scale that 30 \u00baF is 5 \u00baF warmer than 25 \u00baF. A notabl e property of the \\ninterval scale is that zero is not a meaningful value in the sense that zero does not represent nothingness, \\nor the absence of a value. Indeed, 0 \u00baF does not indicate that no temperature exists. Similarly, an \\nelevation of 0 feet does not indicate a lack of elevation; rather, it indicates mean sea level.  \\nRatio data are similar to the interval measurement scale; however, it is based around a meaningful zero \\nvalue. Population density is an example of ratio data whereby a 0 population density indicates that no \\npeople live in the area of interest. Similarly, the Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale as 0 K does imply \\nthat no heat (temperature) is measurable within the given attribute.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  106 \\nSpecific to numeric datasets, data values also can be considered to be discrete or \\ncontinuous. Discrete data are those that maintain a finite number of possible values, \\nwhile continuous data can be represented by an infinite number of values. For example, the number of \\nmature trees on a small property will necessarily be between one and one hundred (for argument\u2019s sake). \\nHowever, the height of those trees represents a continuous data value as there are an infinite number of \\npotential values (e.g., one tree may be 20 feet tall, 20.1 feet, or 20.15 feet, 20.157 fee t, and so forth). \\nPrimary Data Capture \\nNow that we have a sense of the different data types and measurement scales available for use in a GIS, we \\nmust direct our thoughts to how this data can be acquired. Primary data capture is a direct data \\nacquisition methodology that is usually associated with some type of in -the-field effort. In the case of \\nvector data, directly captured data commonly comes from a global positioning system (GPS) or other \\ntypes of surveying equipment such as a total station (Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station \\n(right)\"). Total stations are specialized, primary data capture instruments that combine a theodolite (or \\ntransit), which measures horizontal and vertical angles, with a tool to measure the slope distance from the \\nunit to an observed point. Use of a total station allows field crews to quickly and accurately derive the \\ntopography for a particular landscape. \\nFigure 5.2 GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right) \\n \\nIn the case of GPS, handheld units access positional data from satellites and log the information for \\nsubsequent retrieval. A network of twenty-four navigation satellites is situated around the globe and \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  107 \\nprovides precise coordinate information for any point on the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 5.3 \"Earth Imaging \\nSatellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Maintaining a line of sight to four or more of these satellites provides \\nthe user with reasonably accurate location information. These locations can be collected as individual \\npoints or can be linked together to form lines or polygons depending on user preference. Attribute data \\nsuch as land-use type, telephone pole number, and river name can be simultaneously entered by the user. \\nThis location and attribute data can then be uploaded to the GIS for visualization. Depending on the G PS \\nmake and model, this upload often requires some type of intermediate file conversion via software \\nprovided by the manufacturer of the GPS unit. However, there are some free online resources that can \\nconvert GPS data from one format to another. GPSBabel is an example of such an online resource \\n(http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/gpsbabel). \\nIn addition to the typical GPS unit shown in Figure 5.2 \"GPS Unit (left) and Total Station (right)\", GPS is \\nbecoming increasingly incorporated into other new technologies. For example, smartphones now embed \\nGPS capabilities as a standard technological component. These phone/GPS units maintain comparable \\naccuracy to similarly priced stand-alone GPS units and are largely responsible for a renaissance in \\nfacilitating portable, real-time data capture and sharing to the masses. The ubiquity of this technology led \\nto a proliferation of crowdsourced data acquisition alternatives. Crowdsourcing is a data collection \\nmethod whereby users contribute freely to building spatial databases. This rapidly expanding \\nmethodology is utilized in such applications as TomTom\u2019s MapShare application, Google Earth, Bing \\nMaps, and ArcGIS. \\nRaster data obtained via direct capture comes more commonly from remotely sensed sources ( Figure 5.3 \\n\"Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data\"). Remotely sensed data offers the advantage of \\nobviating the need for physical access to the area being imaged. In addition, huge tracts of land can be \\ncharacterized with little to no additional time and labor by the researcher. On the other hand, validation is \\nrequired for remotely sensed data to ensure that the sensor is not only operating correctly but properly \\ncalibrated to collect the desired information. Satellites and aerial cameras provide the most ubiquitous \\nsources of direct-capture raster data (Chapter 4 \"Data Models for GIS\", Section 4.3.1 \"Satellite Imagery\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  108 \\nFigure 5.3 Earth Imaging Satellite Capturing Primary Data \\n \\nSecondary Data Capture \\nSecondary data capture is an indirect methodology that utilizes the vast amount of existing geospatial data \\navailable in both digital and hard-copy formats. Prior to initiating any GIS effort, it is always wise to mine \\nonline resources for existing GIS data that may fulfill your mapping needs without the potentially \\nintensive step of creating the data from scratch. Such digital GIS data are available from a variety of \\nsources including international agencies (CGIAR, CIESIN, United Nations, World Bank, etc.) ; federal \\ngovernments (USGS, USDA, NOAA, USFWS, NASA, EPA, US Census, etc.); state governments (CDFG, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  109 \\nTeale Data Center, INGIS, MARIS, NH GIS Resources, etc.); local governments (SANDAG, RCLIS, etc.); \\nuniversity websites (UCLA, Duke, Stanford, University of Chicago, Indiana Spatial Data Portal, etc.); and \\ncommercial websites (ESRI, GeoEye, Geocomm, etc.). These secondary data are available in a wide \\nassortment of file types, extents, and sizes but is ready-made to be used in most GIS software packages. \\nOften these data are free, but many sites will charge a fee for access to the proprietary information they \\nhave developed. \\nAlthough these data sources are all cases where the information has been converted to digital format and \\nproperly projected for use in a GIS, there is also a great deal of spatial information that can be gleaned \\nfrom existing, nondigital sources. Paper maps, for example, may contain current or historic information \\non a locale that cannot be found in digital format. In this case, the process  of digitization can be used to \\ncreate digital files from the original paper copy. Three primary methods exist for digitizing spatial \\ninformation: two are manual, and one is automated. \\nTablet digitizing is a manual data capture method whereby a user enters coordinate information into a \\ncomputer through the use of a digitizing tablet and a digitizing puck. To begin, a paper map is secured to a \\nback-lit digitizing tablet. The backlight allows all features on the map to be easily observed, which reduces \\neyestrain. The coordinates of the point, line, and/or polygon features on the paper map are then entered \\ninto a digital file as the user employs a puck, which is similar to a multibutton mouse with a crosshair, to \\n\u201cclick\u201d their way around the vertices of each desired feature. The resulting digital file will need to be \\nproperly georeferenced following completion of the digitization task to ensure that this information will \\nproperly align with existing datasets. \\nHeads-up digitizing, the second manual data capture method, is referred to as \u201con-screen\u201d digitizing. \\nHeads-up digitizing can be used on either paper maps or existing digital files. In the case of a paper map, \\nthe map must first be scanned into the computer at a high enough resolution that will allow all per tinent \\nfeatures to be resolved. Second, the now-digital image must be registered so the map will conform to an \\nexisting coordinate system. To do this, the user can enter control points on the screen and transform, or \\n\u201crubber-sheet,\u201d the scanned image into real world coordinates. Finally, the user simply zooms to specific \\nareas on the map and traces the points, lines, and/or polygons, similar to the tablet digitization example. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  110 \\nHeads-up digitizing is particularly simple when existing GIS files, satellite ima ges, or aerial photographs \\nare used as a baseline. For example, if a user plans to digitize the boundary of a lake as seen from a \\ngeoreferenced satellite image, the steps of scanning and registering can be skipped, and projection \\ninformation from the originating image can simply be copied over to the digitized file. \\nThe third, automated method of secondary data capture requires the user to scan a paper map and \\nvectorize the information therein. This vectorization method typically requires a specific software package \\nthat can convert a raster scan to vector lines. This requires a very high-resolution, clean scan. If the image \\nis not clean, all the imperfections on the map will likely be converted to false points/lines/polygons in the \\ndigital version. If a clean scan is not available, it is often faster to use a manual digitization methodology. \\nRegardless, this method is much quicker than the aforementioned manual methods and may be the best \\noption if multiple maps must be digitized and/or if time is a limiting factor. Often, a semiautomatic \\napproach is employed whereby a map is scanned and vectorized, followed by a heads- up digitizing session \\nto edit and repair any errors that occurred during automation. \\nThe final secondary data capture method worth noting is the use of information from  reports and \\ndocuments. Via this method, one enters information from reports and documents into the attribute \\ntable of an existing, digital GIS file that contains all the pertinent points, lines, and polygons. For example, \\nnew information specific to census tracts may become available following a scientific study. The GIS user \\nsimply needs to download the existing GIS file of census tracts and begin entering the study\u2019s \\nreport/document information directly into the attribute table. If the data tables are available digitally, the \\nuse of the \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201crelate\u201d functions in a GIS (Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\") are often extremely \\nhelpful as they will automate much of the data entry effort. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The most common types of data available for use in a GIS are alphanumeric strings, numbers, Boolean \\nvalues, dates, and binaries. \\n\u2022 Nominal and ordinal data represent categorical data, while interval and ratio data represent numeric \\ndata. \\n\u2022 Data capture methodologies are derived from either primary or secondary sources. \\n Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  111 \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand the basic properties of a relational database management \\nsystem. \\nA database is a structured collection of data files. A database management system (DBMS) is a software \\npackage that allows for the creation, storage, maintenance, manipulation, and retrieval of large \\ndatasets that are distributed over one or more files. A DBMS and its associated functions are usually \\naccessed through commercial software packages such as Microsoft Access, Oracle, FileMaker Pro, or \\nAvanquest MyDataBase. Database management normally refers to the management of tabular data \\nin row and column format and is frequently used for personal, business, government, and scientific \\nendeavors. Geospatial database management systems, alternatively, include the functionality of a \\nDBMS but also contain specific geographic information about each data point such as identity, \\nlocation, shape, and orientation. Integrating this geographic information with the tabular attribute \\ndata of a classical DBMS provide users with powerful tools to visualize and answer the spatially \\nexplicit questions that arise in an increasingly technological society. \\nSeveral types of database models exist, such as the flat, hierarchical, network, and relational models \\n(Worboys 1995; Jackson 1999). [1], [2] A flat database is essentially a spreadsheet whereby all data are \\nstored in a single, large table (Figure 5.4 \"Flat Database\"). A hierarchical database is also a fairly \\nsimple model that organizes data into a \u201cone-to-many\u201d association across levels (Figure 5.5 \\n\"Hierarchical Database\"). Common examples of this model include phylogenetic trees for \\nclassification of plants and animals and familial genealogical trees showing parent-child \\nrelationships. Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases, however, because they also \\nsupport \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationships (Figure 5.6 \"Network Database\"). This expanded capability \\nallows greater search flexibility within the dataset and reduces potential redundancy of information. \\nAlternatively, both the hierarchical and network models can become incredibly complex depending \\non the size of the databases and the number of interactions between the data points. Modern Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  113 \\ngeographic information system (GIS) software typically employs a fourth model referred to as \\na relational database (Codd 1970). [3] \\nFigure 5.4 Flat Database \\n \\nFigure 5.5 Hierarchical Database \\n \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  114 \\nFigure 5.6 Network Database \\n \\nRelational Database Management Systems \\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of tables that are connected in such a \\nway that that data can be accessed without reorganization of the tables. The tables are created such that \\neach column represents a particular attribute (e.g., soil type, PIN number, last name, acreage) and each \\nrow contains a unique instance of data for that columnar attribute (e.g., Delhi Sands Soils, 5555, Smith, \\n412.3 acres) \\nIn the relational model, each table (not surprisingly called a relation) is linked to each other table via \\npredetermined keys (Date 1995). [4] The primary key represents the attribute (column) whose value \\nuniquely identifies a particular record (row) in the relation (table). The primary key may not contain \\nmissing values as multiple missing values would represent nonunique entities that violate the basic rule of \\nthe primary key. The primary key corresponds to an identical attribute in a secondary table (and possibly \\nthird, fourth, fifth, etc.) called a foreign key. This results in all the information in the first table being \\ndirectly related to the information in the second table via the primary and foreign keys, hence the term \\n\u201crelational\u201d DBMS. With these links in place, tables within the database can be kept very simple, resulting \\nin minimal computation time and file complexity. This process can be repeated over many tables as long \\nas each contains a foreign key that corresponds to another table\u2019s primary key. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  115 \\nThe relational model has two primary advantages over the other database models described earlier. First, \\neach table can now be separately prepared, maintained, and edited. This is particularly useful when one \\nconsiders the potentially huge size of many of today\u2019s modern databases. Second, the tables may be \\nmaintained separately until the need for a particular query or analysis calls for the tables to be related. \\nThis creates a large degree of efficiency for processing of information within a given database.  \\nIt may become apparent to the reader that there is great potential for redundancy in this model as each \\ntable must contain an attribute that corresponds to an attribute in every other related table. Therefore, \\nredundancy must actively be monitored and managed in a RDBMS. To accomplish this, a set of rules \\ncalled normal forms have been developed (Codd 1970). [5] There are three basic normal forms. \\nThe first normal form (Figure 5.7 \"First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below)\") refers to five \\nconditions that must be met (Date 1995). [6] They are as follows: \\n1. There is no sequence to the ordering of the rows. \\n2. There is no sequence to the ordering of the columns. \\n3. Each row is unique. \\n4. Every cell contains one and only one value. \\n5. All values in a column pertain to the same subject. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  116 \\nFigure 5.7 First Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe second normal form states that any column that is not a primary key must be dependent on the \\nprimary key. This reduces redundancy by eliminating the potential for mult iple primary keys throughout \\nmultiple tables. This step often involves the creation of new tables to maintain normalization.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  117 \\nFigure 5.8 Second Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nThe third normal form states that all nonprimary keys must depend on the primary key, while the primary \\nkey remains independent of all nonprimary keys. This form was wittily summed up by Kent (1983)  [7] who \\nquipped that all nonprimary keys \u201cmust provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the \\nkey.\u201d Echoing this quote is the rejoinder: \u201cso help me Codd\u201d (personal communication with Foresman \\n1989). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  118 \\nFigure 5.9 Third Normal Form Violation (above) and Fix (below) \\n \\nJoins and Relates \\nAn additional advantage of an RDBMS is that it allows attribute data in separate tables to be linked in a \\npost hoc fashion. The two operations commonly used to accomplish this are the join and relate. \\nThe join operation appends the fields of one table into a second table through the use of an attribute or \\nfield that is common to both tables. This is commonly utilized to combine attribute information from one \\nor more nonspatial data tables (i.e., information taken from reports or documents) with a spatially explicit \\nGIS feature layer. A second type of join combines feature information based on spatial location and \\nassociation rather than on common attributes. In ArcGIS, three types of spatial joins are available. Users \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  119 \\nmay (1) match each feature to the closest feature, (2) match each feature to the feature that it is part of, or \\n(3) match each feature to the feature that it intersects. \\nAlternatively, the relate operation temporarily associates two map layers or tables while keeping them \\nphysically separate. Relates are bidirectional, so data can be accessed from the one of the tables by \\nselecting records in the other table. The relate operation also allows for the association of three or more \\ntables, if necessary. \\nSometimes it can be unclear as to which operation one should use. As a general rule, joins are most \\nsuitable for instances involving one-to-one or many-to-one relationships. Joins are also advantageous due \\nto the fact that the data from the two tables are readily observable in the single output table . The use of \\nrelates, on the other hand, are suitable for all table relationships (one -to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, \\nand many-to-many); however, they can slow down computer access time if the tables are particularly \\nlarge or spread out over remote locations. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Database management systems can be flat, hierarchical, network, or relational.  \\n\u2022 Relational database management systems (RDBMS) utilize primary keys and foreign keys to link data \\ntables. \\n\u2022 The RDBMS model reduces data redundancy by employing three basic \u201cnormal forms.\u201d  \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to overview a sample of the most common types of vector, raster, and \\nhybrid file formats. \\nGeospatial data are stored in many different file formats. Each geographic information system (GIS) \\nsoftware package, and each version of these software packages, supports different formats. This is \\ntrue for both vector and raster data. Although several of the more common file formats are \\nsummarized here, many other formats exist for use in various GIS programs. \\nVector File Formats \\nThe most common vector file format is the shapefile. Shapefiles, developed by ESRI in the early 1990s for \\nuse with the dBASE III database management software package in ArcView 2, are simple, nontopological \\nfiles developed to store the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. \\nShapefiles are incapable of storing null values, as well as annotations or network features. Field names \\nwithin the attribute table are limited to ten characters, and each shapefile can represent only point, line, \\nor polygon feature sets. Supported data types are limited to floating point, integer, date, and text. \\nShapefiles are supported by almost all commercial and open-source GIS software. \\nDespite being called a \u201cshapefile,\u201d this format is actually a compilation of many different files. Table 5.1 \\n\"Shapefile File Types\" lists and describes the different file formats associated with the shapefile. Among \\nthose listed, only the SHP, SHX, and DBF file formats are mandatory to create a functioning shapefile, \\nwhile all others are conditionally required. As a general rule, the names for each file should conform to the \\nMS-DOS 8.3 convention when using older versions of GIS software packages. According to this \\nconvention, the filename prefix can contain up to eight characters, and the filename suffix contains three \\ncharacters. The more recent GIS software packages have relaxed this requirement and will accept longer \\nfilename prefixes. \\nTable 5.1 Shapefile File Types Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  122 \\nFile Extension Purpose \\nSHP* Feature geometry \\nSHX* Index format for the feature geometry \\nDBF* Feature attribute information in dBASE IV format \\nPRJ Projection information \\nSBN and SBX Spatial index of the features \\nFBN and FBX Read-only spatial index of the features \\nAIN and AIH Attribute information for active fields in the table \\nIXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles \\nMXS Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles with ODB format \\nATX Attribute index used in ArcGIS 8 and later \\nSHP.XML Metadata in XML format \\nCPG Code page specifications for identifying character encoding \\n* Indicates mandatory files \\nThe earliest vector format file for use in GIS software packages, which is still in use today, is the \\nArcInfo coverage. This georelational file format supports multiple features types (e.g., points, lines, \\npolygons, annotations) while also storing the topological information associated with those features. \\nAttribute data are stored as multiple files in a separate directory labeled \u201cInfo.\u201d Due to its creation in an \\nMS-DOS environment, these files maintain strict naming conventions. File names cannot be longer than \\nthirteen characters, cannot contain spaces, cannot start with a number, and must be completely in \\nlowercase. Coverages cannot be edited in ArcGIS 9.x or later versions of ESRI\u2019s software package. \\nThe US Census Bureau maintains a specific type of shapefile referred to as TIGER \\norTIGER/Line (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system). Although these \\nopen-source files do not contain actual census information, they map features such as census tracts, \\nroads, railroads, buildings, rivers, and other features that support and improve the bureau and improve \\nthe Bureau\u2019s ability to#8217;s ability to collect census information. TIGER/Line shapefiles, first released \\nin 1990, are topologically explicit and are linked to the Census Bureau\u2019s Master Address File (MAF), Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  123 \\ntherefore enabling the geocoding of street addresses. These files are free to the public and can be freely \\ndownloaded from private vendors that support the format. \\nTheAutoCAD DXF (Drawing Interchange Format or Drawing Exchange Format)is a proprietary vector file \\nformat developed by Autodesk to allow interchange between engineering -based CAD (computer-aided \\ndesign) software and other mapping software packages. DXF files were originally released in 1982 with \\nthe purpose of providing an exact representation of AutoCAD\u2019s native DWG format. Although the DXF is \\nstill commonly used, newer versions of AutoCAD have incorporated more complex data types (e.g., \\nregions, dynamic blocks) that are not supported in the DXF format. Therefore, it may be presumed that \\nthe DXF format may become less popular in geospatial analysis over time.  \\nFinally, the US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains an open-source vector file format that details \\nphysical and cultural features across the United States. These topologically \\nexplicit DLGs (Digital Line Graphics) come in large-, intermediate-, and small-scale depending on \\nwhether they are derived from 1:24,000-; 1:100,000-; or 1:2,000,000-scale USGS topographic \\nquadrangle maps. The features available in the different DLG types depend on the scale of the DLG but \\ngenerally include data such as administrative and political boundaries, hydrography, transportation \\nsystems, hypsography, and land cover. \\nVector data files can also be structured to represent surface elevation information. \\nA TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) is an open-source vector data structure that uses contiguous, \\nnonoverlapping triangles to represent geographic surfaces (Figure 5.10 \"Triangulated Irregular Network \\n(TIN)\"). Whereas the raster depiction of a surface represents elevation as an average value over the spatial \\nextent of the individual pixel (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster File Formats\"), the TIN data structure models \\neach vertex of the triangle as an exact elevation value at a specific po int on the earth. The arcs between \\neach vertex are an approximation of the elevation between two vertices. These arcs are then aggregated \\ninto triangles from which information on elevation, slope, aspect, and surface area can be derived across \\nthe entire extent of the model\u2019s space. Note that term \u201cirregular\u201d in the name of the data model refers to \\nthe fact that the vertices are typically laid out in a scattered fashion.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  124 \\nFigure 5.10 Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) \\n \\nThe use of TINs confers certain advantages over raster-based elevation models (see Section 5.3.2 \"Raster \\nFile Formats\"). First, linear topographic features are very accurately represented relative to their raster \\ncounterpart. Second, a comparatively small number of data points are needed  to represent a surface, so \\nfile sizes are typically much smaller. This is particularly true as vertices can be clustered in areas where \\nrelief is complex and can be sparse in areas where relief is simple. Third, specific elevation data can be \\nincorporated into the data model in a post hoc fashion via the placement of additional vertices if the \\noriginal is deemed insufficient or inadequate. Finally, certain spatial statistics can be calculated that \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  125 \\ncannot be obtained when using a raster-based elevation model, such as flood plain delineation, storage \\ncapacity curves for reservoirs, and time-area curves for hydrographs. \\nRaster File Formats \\nA multitude of raster file format types are available for use in GIS. The selection of raster formats has \\ndramatically increased with the widespread availability of imagery from digital cameras, video recorders, \\nsatellites, and so forth. Raster imagery is typically 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit (16 million colors). Due to \\nongoing technological advancements, raster image file sizes have been getting larger and larger. To deal \\nwith this potential constraint, two types of file compression are commonly used: lossless and \\nlossy. Lossless compression reduces file size without decreasing image quality.  Lossy compression \\nattempts to exploit limitations of the human eye by removing information from the image that cannot be \\nsensed. As you may guess, lossy compression results in smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  \\nAmong the most common raster files used on the web are the JPEG, T IFF, and PNG formats, all of which \\nare open source and can be used with most GIS software packages. \\nThe JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) andTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) raster formats are \\nmost frequently used by digital cameras to store 8-bit values for each of the red, blue, and green colors \\nspaces (and sometimes 16-bit colors, in the case of TIFF images). JPEGs support lossy compression, while \\nTIFFs can be either lossy or lossless. Unlike JPEG, TIFF images can be saved in either RGB or CMYK \\ncolor spaces.PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are 24-bit images that support either lossy or lossless \\ncompression. PNG files are designed for efficient viewing in web-based browsers such as Internet \\nExplorer, Mozilla Firefox, Netscape, and Safari. \\nNative JPEG, TIFF, and PNG files do not have georeferenced information associated with them and \\ntherefore cannot be used in any geospatial mapping efforts. In order to employ these files in a GIS, \\na world file must first be created. A world file is a separate, plaintext data file that specifies the locations \\nand transformations that allow the image to be projected into a standard coordinate system (e.g., \\nUniversal Transverse Mercator [UTM] or State Plane). The filename of the world file is based on the name \\nof the raster file, while a w is typically added into to the file extension. The world file extension name for a \\nJPEG is JPW; for a TIFF, it is TFW; and for a PNG, PGW. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  126 \\nAn example of a raster file format with explicit georeferencing information is the \\nproprietary MrSID (Multiresolution Seamless Image Database) format. This lossless compression format \\nwas developed by LizardTech, Inc., for use with large aerial photographs or satellite images, whereby \\nportions of a compressed image can be viewed quickly without having to decompress the entire file. The \\nMrSID format is frequently used for visualizing orthophotos. \\nLike MrSID, the proprietary ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) format also includes georeferencing \\ninformation within the file structure. This lossy compression format was developed by Earth Resource \\nMapping and supports up to 255 layers of image information. Due to the potentially huge file sizes \\nassociated with an image that supports so many layers, ECW files represent an excellent option for \\nperforming rapid analysis on large images while using a relatively small amount of the computer\u2019s RAM \\n(Random Access Memory), thus accelerating computation speed. \\nLike the open-source, vector-based DLG, DRGs (Digital Raster Graphics)are scanned versions of USGS \\ntopographic maps and include all of the collar material from the originals. The geospatial information \\nfound within the image\u2019s neatline is georeferenced, specifically to the UTM coordinate system. These \\ngraphics are scanned at a minimum of 250 dpi (dots per inch) and therefore have a spatial resolution of \\napproximately 2.4 meters. DRGs contain up to thirteen colors and therefore may look slightly different \\nfrom the originals. In addition, they include all the collar material from the original print vers ion, are \\ngeoreferenced to the surface of the earth, fit the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, and are \\nmost likely based on the NAD27 data points (NAD stands for North American Datum).  \\nLike the TIN vector format, some raster file formats are developed explicitly for modeling elevation. These \\ninclude the USGS DEM, USGS SDTS, and DTED file formats.  \\nTheUSGS DEM (US Geological Survey Digital Elevation Model) is a popular file format due to widespread \\navailability, the simplicity of the model, and the extensive software support for the format. Each pixel \\nvalue in these grid-based DEMs denotes spot elevations on the ground, usually in feet or meters. Care \\nmust be taken when using grid-based DEMs due to the enormous volume of data that accompanies the se \\nfiles as the spatial extent covered in the image begins to increase. DEMs are referred to \\nas digital terrain models (DTMs) when they represent a simple, bare-earth model and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  127 \\nas digital surface models (DSMs)when they include the heights of landscape features such as buildings \\nand trees (Figure 5.11 \"Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right)\" ). \\nFigure 5.11 Digital Surface Model (left) and Digital Terrain Model (right) \\n \\nUSGS DEMs can be classified into one of four levels of quality (labeled 1 to 4) depending on its source \\ndata and resolution. This source data can be 1:24,000-; 1:63,360-; or 1:250,000-scale topographic \\nquadrangles. The DEM format is a single file of ASCII text comprised of three data blocks; A, B, and C. \\nThe A block contains header information such as data origin, type, and measurement systems. The B \\nblock contains contiguous elevation data described as a six-character integer. The C block contains trailer \\ninformation such as root-mean square (RMS) error of the scene. The USGS DEM format has recently been \\nsucceeded by the USGS SDTS (Spatial Data Transfer Standard) DEMformat. The SDTS format [1] was \\nspecifically developed as a distribution format for transferring data from one computer to another with \\nzero data loss. \\nThe DTED (Digital Terrain Elevation Data) format is another elevation specific raster file format. It was \\ndeveloped in the 1970s for military purposes such as line of sight analysis, 3- D visualization, and mission \\nplanning. The DTED format maintains three levels of data over five different latitudinal zones. Level 0 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  128 \\ndata has a resolution of approximately 900 meters; Level 1 data has a resolution of approximately 90 \\nmeters; and Level 2 data has a resolution of approximately 30 meters.  \\nHybrid File Formats \\nA geodatabase is a recently developed, proprietary ESRI file format that supports both vector and raster \\nfeature datasets (e.g., points, lines, polygons, annotation, JPEG, TIFF) within a single file.  This format \\nmaintains topological relationships and is stored as an MDB file. The geodatabase was developed to be a \\ncomprehensive model for representing and modeling geospatial information.  \\nThere are three different types of geodatabases. The personal geodatabase was developed for single-user \\nediting, whereby two editors cannot work on the same geodatabase at a given time. The personal \\ngeodatabase employs the Microsoft Access DBMS file format and maintains a size limit of 2 gigabytes per \\nfile, although it has been noted that performance begins to degrade after file size approaches 250 \\nmegabytes. The personal geodatabase is currently being phased out by ESRI and is therefore not used for \\nnew data creation. \\nThe file geodatabase similarly allows only single-user editing, but this restriction applies only to unique \\nfeature datasets within a geodatabase. The file geodatabase incorporates new tools such as domains (rules \\napplied to attributes), subtypes (groups of objects with a feature class or table), and split/ merge policies \\n(rules to control and define the output of split and merge operations). This format stores information as \\nbinary files with a size limit of 1 terabyte and has been noted to perform and scale much more efficiently \\nthan the personal geodatabase (approximately one-third of the feature geometry storage required by \\nshapefiles and personal geodatabases). File databases are not tied to any specific relational database \\nmanagement system and can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. Finally,  file \\ngeodatabases can be compressed to read-only formats that further reduce file size without subsequently \\nreducing performance. \\nThe third hybrid ESRI format is the ArcSDE geodatabase, which allows multiple editors to simultaneously \\nwork on feature datasets within a single geodatabase (a.k.a. versioning). Like the file geodatabase, this \\nformat can be employed on both Windows and UNIX platforms. File size is limited to 4 gigabytes and its Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  129 \\nproprietary nature requires an ArcInfo or ArcEditor license for use. The ArcSDE geodatabase is \\nimplemented on the SQL Server Express software package, which is a free DBMS platform developed by \\nMicrosoft. \\nIn addition to the geodatabase, Adobe Systems Incorporated\u2019s \\ngeospatial PDF (Portable Document Format) is an open-source format that allows for the representation \\nof geometric entities such as points, lines, and polygons. Geospatial PDFs can be used to find and mark \\ncoordinate pairs, measure distances, reproject files, and georegister raster images. This format is \\nparticularly useful as the PDF is widely accepted to be the preferred standard for printable web \\ndocuments. Although functionally similar, the geospatial PDF should not be confused with the GeoPDF \\nformat developed by TerraGo Technologies. Rather, the GeoPDF is a b randed version of the geospatial \\nPDF. \\nFinally, Google Earth supports a new, open-source, hybrid file format referred to as \\na KML (Keyhole Markup Language). KML files associate points, lines, polygons, images, 3-D models, and \\nso forth, with a longitude and latitude value, as well as other view information such as tilt, heading, \\naltitude, and so forth. KMZ files are commonly encountered, and they are zipped versions KML files.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Common vector file formats used in geospatial applications include shapefiles, coverages, TIGER/Lines, \\nAutoCAD DXFs, and DLGs. \\n\u2022 Common raster file formats used in geospatial applications include JPGs, TIFFs, PNGs, MrSIDs, ECWs, \\nDRGs, USGS DEMs, and DTEDs. \\n\u2022 Common hybrid file formats used in geospatial applications include geodatabases (personal, file, and \\nArcSDE) and geospatial PDFs. \\n \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to ascertain the different types of error inherent in geospatial datasets.  \\nNot all geospatial data are created equally. Data quality refers to the ability of a given dataset to \\nsatisfy the objective for which it was created. With the voluminous amounts of geospatial data being \\ncreated and served to the cartographic community, care must be taken by individual geographic \\ninformation system (GIS) users to ensure that the data employed for their project is suitable for the \\ntask at hand. \\nTwo primary attributes characterize data quality. Accuracy describes how close a measurement is to \\nits actual value and is often expressed as a probability (e.g., 80 percent of all points are within +/\u2212 5 \\nmeters of their true locations). Precision refers to the variance of a value when repeated \\nmeasurements are taken. A watch may be correct to 1/1000th of a second (precise) but may be 30 \\nminutes slow (not accurate). As you can see in Figure 5.12 \"Accuracy and Precision\", the blue darts \\nare both precise and accurate, while the red darts are precise but inaccurate. \\nFigure 5.12 Accuracy and Precision \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  131 \\nSeveral types of error can arise when accuracy and/or precision requirements are not met during \\ndata capture and creation. Positional accuracy is the probability of a feature being within +/\u2212 units of \\neither its true location on earth (absolute positional accuracy) or its location in relation to other \\nmapped features (relative positional accuracy). For example, it could be said that a particular \\nmapping effort may result in 95 percent of trees being mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet for their true \\nlocation (absolute), or 95 percent of trees are mapped to within +/\u2212 5 feet of their location as \\nobserved on a digital ortho quarter quadrangle (relative). \\nSpeaking about absolute positional error does beg the question, however, of what exactly is the true \\nlocation of an object? As discussed in Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", differing conceptions of the earth\u2019s \\nshape has led to a plethora of projections, data points, and spheroids, each attempting to clarify \\npositional errors for particular locations on the earth. To begin addressing this unanswerable \\nquestion, the US National Map Accuracy Standard (or NMAS) suggests that to meet horizontal \\naccuracy requirements, a paper map is expected to have no more than 10 percent of measurable \\npoints fall outside the accuracy values range shown in Figure 5.13 \"Relation between Positional Error \\nand Scale\". Similarly, the vertical accuracy of no more than 10 percent of elevations on a contour \\nmap shall be in error of more than one-half the contour interval. Any map that does not meet these \\nhorizontal and vertical accuracy standards will be deemed unacceptable for publication. \\nFigure 5.13 Relation between Positional Error and Scale \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  132 \\nPositional errors arise via multiple sources. The process of digitizing paper maps commonly \\nintroduces such inaccuracies. Errors can arise while registering the map on the digitizing board. A \\npaper map can shrink, stretch, or tear over time, changing the dimensions of the scene. Input errors \\ncreated from hastily digitized points are common. Finally, converting between coordinate systems \\nand transforming between data points may also introduce errors to the dataset. \\nThe root-mean square (RMS) error is frequently used to evaluate the degree of inaccuracy in a \\ndigitized map. This statistic measures the deviation between the actual (true) and estimated \\n(digitized) locations of the control points. Figure 5.14 \"Potential Digitization Error\" illustrates the \\ninaccuracies of lines representing soil types that result from input control point location errors. By \\napplying an RMS error calculation to the dataset, one could determine the accuracy of the digitized \\nmap and thus determine its suitability for inclusion in a given study. \\nFigure 5.14 Potential Digitization Error \\n \\nPositional errors can also arise when features to be mapped are inherently vague. Take the example \\nof a wetland (Figure 5.15 \"Defining a Wetland Boundary\"). What defines a wetland boundary? \\nWetlands are determined by a combination of hydrologic, vegetative, and edaphic factors. Although \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers is currently responsible for defining the boundary of wetlands \\nthroughout the country, this task is not as simple as it may seem. In particular, regional differences \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  133 \\nin the characteristics of a wetland make delineating these features particularly troublesome. For \\nexample, the definition of a wetland boundary for the riverine wetlands in the eastern United States, \\nwhere water is abundant, is often useless when delineating similar types of wetlands in the desert \\nsouthwest United States. Indeed, the complexity and confusion associated with the conception of \\nwhat a \u201cwetland\u201d is may result in difficulties defining the feature in the field, which subsequently \\nleads to positional accuracy errors in the GIS database. \\nFigure 5.15 Defining a Wetland Boundary \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  134 \\nIn addition to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy is a common source of error in a GIS. Attribute \\nerrors can occur when an incorrect value is recorded within the attribute field or when a field is \\nmissing a value. Misspelled words and other typographical errors are common as well. Similarly, a \\ncommon inaccuracy occurs when developers enter \u201c0\u201d in an attribute field when the value is actually \\n\u201cnull.\u201d This is common in count data where \u201c0\u201d would represent zero findings, while a \u201cnull\u201d would \\nrepresent a locale where no data collection effort was undertaken. In the case of categorical values, \\ninaccuracies occasionally occur when attributes are mislabeled. For example, a land-use/land-cover \\nmap may list a polygon as \u201cagricultural\u201d when it is, in fact, \u201cresidential.\u201d This is particularly true if \\nthe dataset is out of date, which leads us to our next source of error. \\nTemporal accuracy addresses the age or timeliness of a dataset. No dataset is ever completely current. \\nIn the time it takes to create the dataset, it has already become outdated. Regardless, there are \\nseveral dates to be aware of while using a dataset. These dates should be found within the metadata. \\nThe publication date will tell you when the dataset was created and/or released. The field date relates \\nthe date and time the data was collected. If the dataset contains any future prediction, there should \\nalso be a forecast period and/or date. To address temporal accuracy, many datasets undergo a \\nregular data update regimen. For example, the California Department of Fish and Game updates its \\nsensitive species databases on a near monthly basis as new findings are continually being made. It is \\nimportant to ensure that, as an end-user, you are constantly using the most up-to-date data for your \\nGIS application. \\nThe fourth type of accuracy in a GIS is logical consistency. Logical consistency requires that the data \\nare topologically correct. For example, does a stream segment of a line shapefile fall within the \\nfloodplain of the corresponding polygon shapefile? Do roadways connect at nodes? Do all the \\nconnections and flows point in the correct direction in a network? In regards to the last question, the \\nauthor was recently using an unnamed smartphone application to navigate a busy city roadway and \\nwas twice told to turn the wrong direction down one-way streets. So beware, errors in logical \\nconsistency may lead to traffic violations, or worse! Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  135 \\nThe final type of accuracy is data completeness. Comprehensive inclusion of all features within the \\nGIS database is required to ensure accurate mapping results. Simply put, all the data must be present \\nfor a dataset to be accurate. Are all of the counties in the state represented? Are all of the stream \\nsegments included in the river network? Is every convenience store listed in the database? Are only \\ncertain types of convenience stores listed within the database? Indeed, incomplete data will \\ninevitably lead to incomplete or insufficient analysis. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 All geospatial data contains error. \\n\u2022 Accuracy represents how close a measurement is to its actual value, while precision refers to the variance \\nof a value when repeated measurements are taken. \\n\u2022 The five types of error in a geospatial dataset are related to positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, \\ntemporal accuracy, logical consistency, and data completeness. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. What are the five types of accuracy/precision errors associated geographic information? Provide an \\nexample of each type of error. \\n2. Per the description of the positional accuracy of wetland boundaries, discuss a map feature whose \\nboundaries are inherently vague and difficult to map. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  136 \\nChapter 6 \\n \\nData Characteristics and Visualization \\nIn previous chapters, we learned how geographic information system (GIS) software packages use \\ndatabases to store extensive attribute information for geospatial features within a map. The true \\nusefulness of this information, however, is not realized until similarly powerful analytical tools are \\nemployed to access, process, and simplify the data. To accomplish this, GIS typically provides \\nextensive tools for searching, querying, describing, summarizing, and classifying datasets. With these \\ndata exploration tools, even the most expansive datasets can be mined to provide users the ability to \\nmake meaningful insights into and statements about that information. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  137 \\n6.1 Descriptions and Summaries \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review the most frequently used measures of distribution, central \\ntendency, and dispersion. \\nNo discussion of geospatial analysis would be complete without a brief overview of basic statistical \\nconcepts. The basic statistics outlined here represent a starting point for any attempt to describe, \\nsummarize, and analyze geospatial datasets. An example of a common geospatial statistical endeavor \\nis the analysis of point data obtained by a series of rainfall gauges patterned throughout a particular \\nregion. Given these rain gauges, one could determine the typical amount and variability of rainfall at \\neach station, as well as typical rainfall throughout the region as a whole. In addition, you could \\ninterpolate the amount of rainfall that falls between each station or the location where the most (or \\nleast) rainfall occurs. Furthermore, you could predict the expected amount of rainfall into the future \\nat each station, between each station, or within the region as a whole. \\nThe increase of computational power over the past few decades has given rise to vast datasets that \\ncannot be summarized easily. Descriptive statistics provide simple numeric descriptions of these large \\ndatasets. Descriptive statistics tend to be univariate analyses, meaning they examine one variable at a \\ntime. There are three families of descriptive statistics that we will discuss here: measures of \\ndistribution, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion. However, before we delve \\ntoo deeply into various statistical techniques, we must first define a few terms. \\n\u2022 Variable: a symbol used to represent any given value or set of values  \\n\u2022 Value: an individual observation of a variable (in a geographic information system [GIS] this is \\nalso called a record) \\n\u2022 Population: the universe of all possible values for a variable \\n\u2022 Sample: a subset of the population \\n\u2022 n: the number of observations for a variable \\n\u2022 Array: a sequence of observed measures (in a GIS this is also called a field and is represented in \\nan attribute table as a column) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  138 \\n\u2022 Sorted Array: an ordered, quantitative array \\nMeasures of Distribution \\nThe measure of distribution of a variable is merely a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset (hence, this is often called a frequency distribution). Typically, the values for the given variable \\nwill be grouped into a predetermined series of classes (also called intervals, bins, or categories), and the \\nnumber of data values that fall into each class will be summarized. A graph showing the number of data \\nvalues within each class range is called a histogram. For example, the percentage grades received by a \\nclass on an exam may result in the following array (n = 30): \\nArray of Exam Scores: {87, 76, 89, 90, 64, 67, 59, 79, 88, 74, 72, 99, 81, 77, 75, 86, 94, 66, 75, 74, 83, \\n100, 92, 75, 73, 70, 60, 80, 85, 57} \\nWhen placing this array into a frequency distribution, the following general guidelines should be \\nobserved. First, between five and fifteen different classes should be employed, although the exact number \\nof classes depends on the number of observations. Second, each observation goes into one and only one \\nclass. Third, when possible, use classes that cover an equal range of values (Freund and Perles \\n2006). [1] With these guidelines in mind, the exam score array shown earlier can be visualized  with the \\nfollowing histogram (Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ). \\nFigure 6.1 Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  139 \\nAs you can see from the histogram, certain descriptive observations can be readily made. Most students \\nreceived a C on the exam (70\u201379). Two students failed the exam (50\u201359). Five students received an A \\n(90\u201399). Note that this histogram does violate the third basic rule that each class cover an equal range \\nbecause an F grade ranges from 0\u201359, whereas the other grades have ranges of equal size. Regardless, in \\nthis case we are most concerned with describing the distribution of grades received during the exam. \\nTherefore, it makes perfect sense to create class ranges that best suit ou r individual needs. \\nMeasures of Central Tendency \\nWe can further explore the exam score array by applying measures of central tendency. There are three \\nprimary measures of central tendency: the mean, mode, and median. The mean, more commonly referred \\nto as the average, is the most often used measure of central tendency. To calculate the mean, simply add \\nall the values in the array and divide that sum by the number of observations. To return to the exam score \\nexample from earlier, the sum of that array is 2,340, and there are 30 observations (n = 30). So, the mean \\nis 2,340 / 30 = 78. \\nThe mode is the measure of central tendency that represents the most frequently occurring value in the \\narray. In the case of the exam scores, the mode of the array is 75 as this w as received by the most number \\nof students (three, in total). Finally, the median is the observation that, when the array is ordered from \\nlowest to highest, falls exactly in the center of the sorted array. More specifically, the median is the value \\nin the middle of the sorted array when there are an odd number of observations. Alternatively, when there \\nis an even number of observations, the median is calculated by finding the mean of the two central values. \\nIf the array of exam scores were reordered into a sorted array, the scores would be listed thusly:  \\nSorted Array of Exam Scores: {57, 59, 60, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72, 73, 74, 74, 75, 75, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, \\n83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 99} \\nSince n = 30 in this example, there are an even number of observations. Therefore, the mean of the two \\ncentral values (15th = 76 and 16th = 77) is used to calculate the median as described earlier, resulting in (76 \\n+ 77) / 2 = 76.5. Taken together, the mean, mode, and median represent the most basic ways to exam ine \\ntrends in a dataset. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  140 \\nMeasures of Dispersion \\nThe third type of descriptive statistics is measures of dispersion (also referred to as measures of \\nvariability). These measures describe the spread of data around the mean. The simplest measure of \\ndispersion is the range. The range equals the largest value minus in the dataset the smallest. In our case, \\nthe range is 99 \u2212 57 = 42. \\nThe interquartile range represents a slightly more sophisticated measure of dispersion. This method \\ndivides the data into quartiles. To accomplish this, the median is used to divide the sorted array into two \\nhalves. These halves are again divided into halves by their own median. The first quartile (Q1) is the \\nmedian of the lower half of the sorted array and is also referred to as the lower quartile. Q2 represents the \\nmedian. Q3 is the median of the upper half of the sorted array and is referred to as the upper quartile. The \\ndifference between the upper and lower quartile is the interquartile range. In the exam score example, Q1 \\n= 72.25 and Q3 = 86.75. Therefore, the interquartile range for this dataset is 86.75 \u2212 72.25 = 14.50.  \\nA third measure of dispersion is the variance (s2). To calculate the variance, subtract the raw value of each \\nexam score from the mean of the exam scores. As you may guess, some of the differences will be positive, \\nand some will be negative, resulting in the sum of differences equaling zero. As we are more interested in \\nthe magnitude of differences (or deviations) from the mean, one method to overcome this \u201czeroing\u201d \\nproperty is to square each deviation, thus removing the negative values from the output ( Figure 6.2). This \\nresults in the following: \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  141 \\nFigure 6.2 \\n \\nWe then divide the sum of squares by either n \u2212 1 (in the case of working with a sample) or n (in the case \\nof working with a population). As the exam scores given here represent the entire population of the class, \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  142 \\nwe will employ Figure 6.3 \"Variance\", which results in a variance of s2 = 116.4. If we wanted to use these \\nexam scores to extrapolate information about the larger student body, we would be working with a sample \\nof the population. In that case, we would divide the sum of squares by  n \u2212 1. \\nFigure 6.3 Variance \\n \\nStandard deviation, the final measure of dispersion discussed here, is the most commonly used measure \\nof dispersion. To compensate for the squaring of each difference from the mean performed during the \\nvariance calculation, standard deviation takes the square root of the variance. As determined from Figure \\n6.4 \"Standard Deviation\", our exam score example results in a standard deviation of s = SQRT(116.4) = \\n10.8. \\nFigure 6.4 Standard Deviation \\n \\nCalculating the standard deviation allows us to make some notable inferences about the dispersion of our \\ndataset. A small standard deviation suggests the values in the dataset are clustered around the mean, \\nwhile a large standard deviation suggests the values are scattered widely around the mean. Additional \\ninferences may be made about the standard deviation if the dataset conforms to a normal distribution. A \\nnormal distribution implies that the data, when placed into a frequency distribution (histogram), looks \\nsymmetrical or \u201cbell-shaped.\u201d When not \u201cnormal,\u201d the frequency distribution of dataset is said to be \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  143 \\npositively or negatively \u201cskewed\u201d (Figure 6.5 \"Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and \\nNegatively Skewed Datasets\"). Skewed data are those that maintain values that are not symmetrical \\naround the mean. Regardless, normally distributed data maintains the property of having approxim ately \\n68 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 95 percent of the data \\nvalue fall within \u00b1 2 standard deviations of the mean. In our example, the mean is 78, and the standard \\ndeviation is 10.8. It can therefore be stated that 68 percent of the scores fall between 67.2 and 88.8 (i.e., \\n78 \u00b1 10.8), while 95 percent of the scores fall between 56.4 and 99.6 (i.e., 78 \u00b1 [10.8 * 2]). For datasets \\nthat do not conform to the normal curve, it can be assumed that 75 percent of the data values fall within \u00b1 \\n2 standard deviations of the mean. \\nFigure 6.5 Histograms of Normally Curved, Positively Skewed, and Negatively Skewed Datasets \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 The measure of distribution for a given variable is a summary of the frequency of values over the range of \\nthe dataset and is commonly shown using a histogram. \\n\u2022 Measures of central tendency attempt to provide insights into \u201ctypical\u201d value for a dataset.  \\n\u2022 Measures of dispersion (or variability) describe the spread of data around the mean o r median. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to outline the basics of the SQL language and to understand the various \\nquery techniques available in a GIS. \\nAccess to robust search and query tools is essential to examine the general trends of a dataset.  Queries are \\nessentially questions posed to a database. The selective display and retrieval of information based on \\nthese queries are essential components of any geographic information system (GIS). There are three basic \\nmethods for searching and querying attribute data: (1) selection, (2) query by attribute, and (3) query by \\ngeography. \\nSelection \\nSelection represents the easiest way to search and query spatial data in a GIS. Sele cting features highlight \\nthose attributes of interest, both on-screen and in the attribute table, for subsequent display or analysis. \\nTo accomplish this, one selects points, lines, and polygons simply by using the cursor to \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d \\nthe feature of interest or by using the cursor to drag a box around those features. Alternatively, one can \\nselect features by using a graphic object, such as a circle, line, or polygon, to highlight all of those features \\nthat fall within the object. Advanced options for selecting subsets of data from the larger dataset include \\ncreating a new selection, selecting from the currently selected features, adding to the current selection, \\nand removing from the current selection. \\nQuery by Attribute \\nMap features and their associated data can be retrieved via the query of attribute information within the \\ndata tables. For example, search and query tools allow a user to show all the census tracts that have a \\npopulation density of 500 or greater, to show all counties that are less than or equal to 100 square \\nkilometers, or to show all convenience stores within 1 mile of an interstate highway.  \\nSpecifically, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a commonly used computer language developed to \\nquery attribute data within a relational database management system. Created by IBM in the 1970s, SQL Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  145 \\nallows for the retrieval of a subset of attribute information based on specific, user -defined criteria via the \\nimplementation of particular language elements. More recently, the use of SQL has been extended for use \\nin a GIS (Shekhar and Chawla 2003).[1] One important note related to the use of SQL is that the exact \\nexpression used to query a dataset depends on the GIS file format being examined. For example, ANSI \\nSQL is a particular version used to query ArcSDE geodatabases, while Jet SQL is used to access personal \\ngeodatabases. Similarly, shapefiles, coverages, and dBASE tables use a restricted version of SQL that \\ndoesn\u2019t support all the features of ANSI SQL or Jet SQL. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.2 \"Geospatial Database \\nManagement\", all attribute tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for an SQL \\nquery must contain primary and/or foreign keys for proper use. In addition to these keys, SQL \\nimplements clauses to structure database queries. A clause is a language element that includes the \\nSELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING query statements.  \\n\u2022 SELECT denotes what attribute table fields you wish to view. \\n\u2022 FROM denotes the attribute table in which the information resides.  \\n\u2022 WHERE denotes the user-defined criteria for the attribute information that must be met in order \\nfor it to be included in the output set. \\n\u2022 ORDER BY denotes the sequence in which the output set will be displayed.  \\n\u2022 HAVING denotes the predicate used to filter output from the ORDER BY clause.  \\nWhile the SELECT and FROM clauses are both mandatory statements in an SQL query, the WHERE is an \\noptional clause used to limit the output set. The ORDER BY and HAVING are optional clauses used to \\npresent the information in an interpretable manner. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  146 \\nFigure 6.6 Personal Addresses in \u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table \\n \\nThe following is a series of SQL expressions and results when applied to Figure 6.6 \"Personal Addresses in \\n\u201cExampleTable\u201d Attribute Table\". The title of the attribute table is \u201cExampleTable.\u201d Note that the asterisk \\n(*) denotes a special case of SELECT whereby all columns for a given record are selected:  \\nSELECT * FROM ExampleTable WHERE City = \u201cUpland\u201d \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  147 \\nThis statement returns the following: \\n \\nConsider the following statement: \\nSELECT LastName FROM ExampleTable WHERE State = \u201cCA\u201d ORDER BY FirstName \\nThis statement results in the following table sorted in ascending order by the FirstName column (not \\nincluded in the output table as directed by the SELECT clause): \\n \\nIn addition to clauses, SQL allows for the inclusion of specific operators to further delimit the result of \\nquery. These operators can be relational, arithmetic, or Boolean and will typically appear inside of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  148 \\nconditional statements in the WHERE clause. A relational operator employs the statements equal to (=), \\nless than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), or greater than or equal to \\n(>=). Arithmetic operators are those mathematical functions that include addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), \\nmultiplication (*), and division (/). Boolean operators (also called Boolean connectors) include the \\nstatements AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. The AND connector is used to select records from the attribute \\ntable that satisfies both expressions. The OR connector selects records that satisfy either one or both \\nexpressions. The XOR connector selects records that satisfy one and only one of the expressions (the \\nfunctional opposite of the AND connector). Lastly, the NOT connector is used to negate (or unsele ct) an \\nexpression that would otherwise be true. Put into the language of probability, the AND connector is used \\nto represent an intersection, OR represents a union, and NOT represents a complement.  Figure 6.7 \"Venn \\nDiagram of SQL Operators\" illustrates the logic of these connectors, where circles A and B represent two \\nsets of intersecting data. Keep in mind that SQL is a very exacting language and minor inconsistencies in \\nthe statement, such as additional spaces, can result in a failed query.  \\nFigure 6.7 Venn Diagram of SQL Operators \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  149 \\nUsed together, these operators combine to provide the GIS user with powerful and flexible search and \\nquery options. With this in mind, can you determine the output set of the following SQL query as it is \\napplied to Figure 6.1 \"Histogram Showing the Frequency Distribution of Exam Scores\" ? \\nSELECT LastName, FirstName, StreetNumber FROM ExampleTable WHERE StreetNumber >= 10000 \\nAND StreetNumber < 100 ORDER BY LastName \\nThe following are the results: \\n \\nQuery by Geography \\nQuery by geography, also known as a \u201cspatial query,\u201d allows one to highlight particular features by \\nexamining their position relative to other features. For example, a GIS provides robust tools that allow for \\nthe determination of the number of schools within 10 miles of a home. Several spatial query options are \\navailable, as outlined here. Throughout this discussion, the \u201ctarget layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset \\nwhose attributes are selected, while the \u201csource layer\u201d refers to the feature dataset on which the spatial \\nquery is applied. For example, if we were to use a state boundary polygon feature dataset to select \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  150 \\nhighways from a line feature dataset (e.g., select all the highways that run through the state of Arkansas), \\nthe state layer is the source, while the highway layer is the target.  \\n\u2022 INTERSECT. This oft-used spatial query technique selects all features in the target layer that \\nshare a common locale with the source layer. The \u201cintersect\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used as both the source and target layers (Figure 6.8). \\nFigure 6.8 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  151 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they intersect the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE WITHIN A DISTANCE OF. This technique requires the user to specify some distance \\nvalue, which is then used to buffer (Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", Section \\n7.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") the source layer. All features that intersect this buffer are \\nhighlighted in the target layer. The \u201care within a distance of\u201d query allows points, lines, or polygon \\nlayers to be used for both the source and target layers (Figure 6.9). \\nFigure 6.9 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  152 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are within the selected distance \\nof the red features; tan areas represent buffers around the various features. \\n\u2022 COMPLETELY CONTAIN. This spatial query technique returns those features that are entirely \\nwithin the source layer. Features with coincident boundaries are not selected by this query type. \\nThe \u201ccompletely contain\u201d query allows for points, lines, or polygons as the source layer, but only \\npolygons can be used as a target layer (Figure 6.10). \\nFigure 6.10 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they completely contain the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 ARE COMPLETELY WITHIN. This query selects those features in the target layer whose entire \\nspatial extent occurs within the geometry of the source layer. The \u201care completely within\u201d query \\nallows for points, lines, or polygons as the target layer, but only polygons can be used as a source \\nlayer (Figure 6.11). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  153 \\nFigure 6.11 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are completely within the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 HAVE THEIR CENTER IN. This technique selects target features whose center, or centroid, is \\nlocated within the boundary of the source feature dataset. The \u201chave their center in\u201d query allows \\npoints, lines, or polygon layers to be used as both the source and target layers ( Figure 6.12). \\nFigure 6.12 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  154 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they have their centers in the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 SHARE A LINE SEGMENT. This spatial query selects target features whose boundary \\ngeometries share a minimum of two adjacent vertices with the source layer. The \u201cshare a line \\nsegment\u201d query allows for line or polygon layers to be used for either of the source and target \\nlayers (Figure 6.13). \\nFigure 6.13 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  155 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they share a line segment with the \\nred features. \\n\u2022 TOUCH THE BOUNDARY OF. This methodology is similar to the INTERSECT spatial query; \\nhowever, it selects line and polygon features that share a common boundary with target layer. The \\n\u201ctouch the boundary of\u201d query allows for line or polygon layers to be used as both the source and \\ntarget layers (Figure 6.14). \\nFigure 6.14 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  156 \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they touch the boundary of the red \\nfeatures. \\n\u2022 ARE IDENTICAL TO. This spatial query returns features that have the exact same geographic \\nlocation. The \u201care identical to\u201d query can be used on points, lines, or polygons, but the target layer \\ntype must be the same as the source layer type (Figure 6.15). \\nFigure 6.15 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are identical to the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE CROSSED BY THE OUTLINE OF. This selection criteria returns features that share a \\nsingle vertex but not an entire line segment. The \u201care crossed by the outline of\u201d query allows for \\nline or polygon layers to be used as both source and target layers (Figure 6.16). \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  157 \\nFigure 6.16 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they are crossed by the outline of the \\nred features. \\n\u2022 CONTAIN. This method is similar to the COMPLETELY CONTAIN spatial query; however, \\nfeatures in the target layer will be selected even if the boundaries overlap. The \u201ccontain\u201d query \\nallows for point, line, or polygon features in the target layer when points are used as a  source; \\nwhen line and polygon target layers with a line source; and when only polygon target layers with a \\npolygon source (Figure 6.17). \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  158 \\nFigure 6.17 \\n \\nThe highlighted blue and yellow features are selected because they contain the red features. \\n\u2022 ARE CONTAINED BY.

The objective of this section is to describe the methodologies available to parse data into various classes \\nfor visual representation in a map. \\nThe process of data classification combines raw data into predefined classes, or bins. These classes \\nmay be represented in a map by some unique symbols or, in the case of choropleth maps, by a unique \\ncolor or hue (for more on color and hue, see Chapter 8 \"Geospatial Analysis II: Raster Data\", Section \\n8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"). Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated \\ncolors to represent some statistical variable of interest. Although seemingly straightforward, there \\nare several different classification methodologies available to a cartographer. These methodologies \\nbreak the attribute values down along various interval patterns. Monmonier (1991) [1]noted that \\ndifferent classification methodologies can have a major impact on the interpretability of a given map \\nas the visual pattern presented is easily distorted by manipulating the specific interval breaks of the \\nclassification. In addition to the methodology employed, the number of classes chosen to represent \\nthe feature of interest will also significantly affect the ability of the viewer to interpret the mapped \\ninformation. Including too many classes can make a map look overly complex and confusing. Too \\nfew classes can oversimplify the map and hide important data trends. Most effective classification \\nattempts utilize approximately four to six distinct classes. \\nWhile problems potentially exist with any classification technique, a well-constructed choropleth \\nincreases the interpretability of any given map. The following discussion outlines the classification \\nmethods commonly available in geographic information system (GIS) software packages. In these \\nexamples, we will use the US Census Bureau\u2019s population statistic for US counties in 1997. These \\ndata are freely available at the US Census website (http://www.census.gov). \\nThe equal interval (or equal step) classification method divides the range of attribute values into \\nequally sized classes. The number of classes is determined by the user. The equal interval \\nclassification method is best used for continuous datasets such as precipitation or temperature. In \\nthe case of the 1997 Census Bureau data, county population values across the United States range Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  162 \\nfrom 40 (Yellowstone National Park County, MO) to 9,184,770 (Los Angeles County, CA) for a total \\nrange of 9,184,770 \u2212 40 = 9,184,730. If we decide to classify this data into 5 equal interval classes, \\nthe range of each class would cover a population spread of 9,184,730 / 5 = 1,836,946 (Figure 6.19 \\n\"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data\"). The advantage of the equal \\ninterval classification method is that it creates a legend that is easy to interpret and present to a \\nnontechnical audience. The primary disadvantage is that certain datasets will end up with most of \\nthe data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will occupy the other \\nclasses. As you can see in Figure 6.19 \"Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population \\nData\", almost all the counties are assigned to the first (yellow) bin. \\nFigure 6.19 Equal Interval Classification for 1997 US County Population Data \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  163 \\nThe quantile classification method places equal numbers of observations into each class. This method \\nis best for data that is evenly distributed across its range. Figure 6.20 \"Quantiles\" shows the quantile \\nclassification method with five total classes. As there are 3,140 counties in the United States, each \\nclass in the quantile classification methodology will contain 3,140 / 5 = 628 different counties. The \\nadvantage to this method is that it often excels at emphasizing the relative position of the data values \\n(i.e., which counties contain the top 20 percent of the US population). The primary disadvantage of \\nthe quantile classification methodology is that features placed within the same class can have wildly \\ndiffering values, particularly if the data are not evenly distributed across its range. In addition, the \\nopposite can also happen whereby values with small range differences can be placed into different \\nclasses, suggesting a wider difference in the dataset than actually exists. \\nFigure 6.20 Quantiles \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  164 \\nThe natural breaks (or Jenks) classification method utilizes an algorithm to group values in classes \\nthat are separated by distinct break points. This method is best used with data that is unevenly \\ndistributed but not skewed toward either end of the distribution. Figure 6.21 \"Natural Breaks\" shows \\nthe natural breaks classification for the 1997 US county population density data. One potential \\ndisadvantage is that this method can create classes that contain widely varying number ranges. \\nAccordingly, class 1 is characterized by a range of just over 150,000, while class 5 is characterized by \\na range of over 6,000,000. In cases like this, it is often useful to either \u201ctweak\u201d the classes following \\nthe classification effort or to change the labels to some ordinal scale such as \u201csmall, medium, or \\nlarge.\u201d The latter example, in particular, can result in a map that is more comprehensible to the \\nviewer. A second disadvantage is the fact that it can be difficult to compare two or more maps created \\nwith the natural breaks classification method because the class ranges are so very specific to each \\ndataset. In these cases, datasets that may not be overly disparate may appear so in the output \\ngraphic. \\nFigure 6.21 Natural Breaks \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  165 \\nFinally, the standard deviation classification method forms each class by adding and subtracting the \\nstandard deviation from the mean of the dataset. The method is best suited to be used with data that \\nconforms to a normal distribution. In the county population example, the mean is 85,108, and the \\nstandard deviation is 277,080. Therefore, as can be seen in the legend of Figure 6.22 \"Standard \\nDeviation\", the central class contains values within a 0.5 standard deviation of the mean, while the \\nupper and lower classes contain values that are 0.5 or more standard deviations above or below the \\nmean, respectively. \\nFigure 6.22 Standard Deviation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  166 \\nIn conclusion, there are several viable data classification methodologies that can be applied to \\nchoropleth maps. Although other methods are available (e.g., equal area, optimal), those outlined \\nhere represent the most commonly used and widely available. Each of these methods presents the \\ndata in a different fashion and highlights different aspects of the trends in the dataset. Indeed, the \\nclassification methodology, as well as the number of classes utilized, can result in very widely varying \\ninterpretations of the dataset. It is incumbent upon you, the cartographer, to select the method that \\nbest suits the needs of the study and presents the data in as meaningful and transparent a way as \\npossible. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Choropleth maps are thematic maps shaded with graduated colors to represent some statistical variable \\nof interest. \\n\u2022 Four methods for classifying data presented here include equal intervals, quartile, natural breaks, and \\nstandard deviation. These methods convey certain advantages and disadvantages when visualizing a \\nvariable of interest. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

In this chapter, we \\ndiscuss the basic spatial analysis techniques for vector datasets. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  168 \\n7.1 Single Layer Analysis \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the variety of single \\noverlay analysis techniques available to analyze and manipulate the spatial attributes of a vector feature \\ndataset. \\nAs the name suggests, single layer analyses are those that are undertaken on an individual feature \\ndataset. Buffering is the process of creating an output polygon layer containing a zone (or zones) of a \\nspecified width around an input point, line, or polygon feature. Buffers are particularly suited for \\ndetermining the area of influence around features of interest. Geoprocessing is a suite of tools \\nprovided by many geographic information system (GIS) software packages that allow the user to \\nautomate many of the mundane tasks associated with manipulating GIS data. Geoprocessing usually \\ninvolves the input of one or more feature datasets, followed by a spatially explicit analysis, and \\nresulting in an output feature dataset. \\nBuffering \\nBuffers are common vector analysis tools used to address questions of proximity in a GIS and can be used \\non points, lines, or polygons (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features\" ). For \\ninstance, suppose that a natural resource manager wants to ensure that no areas are disturbed within \\n1,000 feet of breeding habitat for the federally endangered Delhi Sands flower- loving fly (Rhaphiomidas \\nterminatus abdominalis). This species is found only in the few remaining Delhi Sands soil formations of \\nthe western United States. To accomplish this task, a 1,000-foot protection zone (buffer) could be created \\naround all the observed point locations of the species. Alternatively, the manager may decide th at there is \\nnot enough point-specific location information related to this rare species and decide to protect all Delhi \\nSands soil formations. In this case, he or she could create a 1,000-foot buffer around all polygons labeled \\nas \u201cDelhi Sands\u201d on a soil formations dataset. In either case, the use of buffers provides a quick-and-easy \\ntool for determining which areas are to be maintained as preserved habitat for the endangered fly.  \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  169 \\nFigure 7.1 Buffers around Red Point, Line, and Polygon Features \\n \\nSeveral buffering options are available to refine the output. For example, the buffer tool will typically \\nbuffer only selected features. If no features are selected, all features will be buffered. Two primary types of \\nbuffers are available to the GIS users: constant width and variable width. Constant width buffersrequire \\nusers to input a value by which features are buffered (Figure 7.1 \"Buffers around Red Point, Line, and \\nPolygon Features\"), such as is seen in the examples in the preceding paragraph. Variable width buffers, on \\nthe other hand, call on a premade buffer field within the attribute table to determine the buffer width for \\neach specific feature in the dataset (Figure 7.2 \"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) \\nVariable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple Ring Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) \\nNondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\"). \\nIn addition, users can choose to dissolve or not dissolve the boundaries between overlapping, coincident \\nbuffer areas. Multiple ring buffers can be made such that a series of concentric buffer zones (much like an \\narchery target) are created around the originating feature at user- specified distances (Figure 7.2 \\n\"Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multi ple Ring Buffers, \\n(c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer\" ). In the case of \\npolygon layers, buffers can be created that include the originating polygon feature as part of the buffer or \\nthey be created as a doughnut buffer that excludes the input polygon area. Setback buffers are similar to \\ndoughnut buffers; however, they only buffer the area inside of the polygon boundary. Linear features can \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  170 \\nbe buffered on both sides of the line, only on the left, or only on t he right. Linear features can also be \\nbuffered so that the end points of the line are rounded (ending in a half- circle) or flat (ending in a \\nrectangle). \\nFigure 7.2 Additional Buffer Options around Red Features: (a) Variable Width Buffers, (b) Multiple \\nRing Buffers, (c) Doughnut Buffer, (d) Setback Buffer, (e) Nondissolved Buffer, (f) Dissolved Buffer \\n \\nGeoprocessing Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  171 \\n\u201cGeoprocessing\u201d is a loaded term in the field of GIS. The term can (and should) be widely applied to any \\nattempt to manipulate GIS data. However, the term came into common usage due to its application to a \\nsomewhat arbitrary suite of single layer and multiple layer analytical techniques in the Geoprocessing \\nWizard of ESRI\u2019s ArcView software package in the mid-1990s. Regardless, the suite of geoprocessing tools \\navailable in a GIS greatly expand and simplify many of the management and manipulation processes \\nassociated with vector feature datasets. The primary use of these tools is to automate the repetitive \\npreprocessing needs of typical spatial analyses and to assemble exact graphical representations for \\nsubsequent analysis and/or inclusion in presentations and final mapping products. The union, intersect, \\nsymmetrical difference, and identity overlay methods discussed in Section 7.2.2 \"Other Multilayer \\nGeoprocessing Options\" are often used in conjunction with these geoprocessing tools. The following \\nrepresents the most common geoprocessing tools. \\nThe dissolve operation combines adjacent polygon features in a single feature dataset based o n a single \\npredetermined attribute. For example, part (a) ofFigure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing \\nFunctions\" shows the boundaries of seven different parcels of land, owned by four different families \\n(labeled 1 through 4). The dissolve tool automatically combines all adjacent features with the same \\nattribute values. The result is an output layer with the same extent as the original but without all of the \\nunnecessary, intervening line segments. The dissolved output layer is much easier to visually interpret \\nwhen the map is classified according to the dissolved field. \\nThe append operation creates an output polygon layer by combining the spatial extent of two or more \\nlayers (part (d) of Figure 7.3 \"Single Layer Geoprocessing Functions\"). For use with point, line, and \\npolygon datasets, the output layer will be the same feature type as the input layers (which must each be \\nthe same feature type as well). Unlike the dissolve tool, append does not remove the boundary lines \\nbetween appended layers (in the case of lines and polygons). Therefore, it is often useful to perform a \\ndissolve after the use of the append tool to remove these potentially unnecessary dividing lines. Append is \\nfrequently used to mosaic data layers, such as digital US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5- minute \\ntopographic maps, to create a single map for analysis and/or display.

The output layer \\ncontains only those features that are selected during the query. For example, a city planner may choose to \\nperform a select on all areas that are zoned \u201cresidential\u201d so he or she can quickly assess which areas in \\ntown are suitable for a proposed housing development. \\nFinally, the merge operation combines features within a point, line, or polygon layer into a single feature \\nwith identical attribute information. Often, the original features will have different values for a given \\nattribute. In this case, the first attribute encountered is carried over into the attribute table, and the \\nremaining attributes are lost. This operation is particularly useful when polygons are found to be \\nunintentionally overlapping.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to the implementation \\nof basic multiple layer operations and methodologies used on vector feature datasets.  \\nAmong the most powerful and commonly used tools in a geographic information system (GIS) is the \\noverlay of cartographic information. In a GIS, an overlay is the process of taking two or more \\ndifferent thematic maps of the same area and placing them on top of one another to form a new map \\n(Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector Layers, as \\nWell as Raster Layers\"). Inherent in this process, the overlay function combines not only the spatial \\nfeatures of the dataset but also the attribute information as well. \\nFigure 7.4 A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, Line, and Polygon Vector \\nLayers, as Well as Raster Layers \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  175 \\nA common example used to illustrate the overlay process is, \u201cWhere is the best place to put a mall?\u201d \\nImagine you are a corporate bigwig and are tasked with determining where your company\u2019s next \\nshopping mall will be placed. How would you attack this problem? With a GIS at your command, \\nanswering such spatial questions begins with amassing and overlaying pertinent spatial data layers. \\nFor example, you may first want to determine what areas can support the mall by accumulating \\ninformation on which land parcels are for sale and which are zoned for commercial development. \\nAfter collecting and overlaying the baseline information on available development zones, you can \\nbegin to determine which areas offer the most economic opportunity by collecting regional \\ninformation on average household income, population density, location of proximal shopping \\ncenters, local buying habits, and more. Next, you may want to collect information on restrictions or \\nroadblocks to development such as the cost of land, cost to develop the land, community response to \\ndevelopment, adequacy of transportation corridors to and from the proposed mall, tax rates, and so \\nforth. Indeed, simply collecting and overlaying spatial datasets provides a valuable tool for \\nvisualizing and selecting the optimal site for such a business endeavor. \\nOverlay Operations \\nSeveral basic overlay processes are available in a GIS for vector datasets: point -in-polygon, polygon-on-\\npoint, line-on-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-on-polygon. As you may be able to \\ndivine from the names, one of the overlay dataset must always be a line or polygon layer, while the second \\nmay be point, line, or polygon. The new layer produced following the overlay operation is termed the \\n\u201coutput\u201d layer. \\nThe point-in-polygon overlay operation requires a point input layer and a polygon overlay layer. Upon \\nperforming this operation, a new output point layer is returned that includes  all the points that occur \\nwithin the spatial extent of the overlay (Figure 7.4 \"A Map Overlay Combining Information from Point, \\nLine, and Polygon Vector Layers, as Well as Raster Layers\"). In addition, all the points in the output layer \\ncontain their original attribute information as well as the attribute information from the overlay. For \\nexample, suppose you were tasked with determining if an endangered species residing in a national park \\nwas found primarily in a particular vegetation community. The first step would be to acquire the point Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  176 \\noccurrence locales for the species in question, plus a polygon overlay layer showing the vegetation \\ncommunities within the national park boundary. Upon performing the point -in-polygon overlay \\noperation, a new point file is created that contains all the points that occur within the national park. The \\nattribute table of this output point file would also contain information about the vegetation communities \\nbeing utilized by the species at the time of observation. A quick sca n of this output layer and its attribute \\ntable would allow you to determine where the species was found in the park and to review the vegetation \\ncommunities in which it occurred. This process would enable park employees to make informed \\nmanagement decisions regarding which onsite habitats to protect to ensure continued site utilization by \\nthe species. \\nFigure 7.5 Point-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nAs its name suggests, the polygon-on-point overlay operation is the opposite of the point-in-polygon \\noperation. In this case, the polygon layer is the input, while the point layer is the overlay. The polygon \\nfeatures that overlay these points are selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For  \\nexample, given a point dataset containing the locales of some type of crime and a polygon dataset \\nrepresenting city blocks, a polygon-on-point overlay operation would allow police to select the city blocks \\nin which crimes have been known to occur and hence determine those locations where an increased police \\npresence may be warranted. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  177 \\nFigure 7.6 Polygon-on-Point Overlay \\n \\nA line-on-line overlay operation requires line features for both the input and overlay layer. The output \\nfrom this operation is a point or points located precisely at the intersection(s) of the two linear datasets \\n(Figure 7.7 \"Line-on-Line Overlay\"). For example, a linear feature dataset containing railroad tracks may \\nbe overlain on linear road network. The resulting point dataset contain s all the locales of the railroad \\ncrossings over a town\u2019s road network. The attribute table for this railroad crossing point dataset would \\ncontain information on both the railroad and the road over which it passed.  \\nFigure 7.7 Line-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nThe line-in-polygon overlay operation is similar to the point-in-polygon overlay, with that obvious \\nexception that a line input layer is used instead of a point input layer. In this case, each line that has any \\npart of its extent within the overlay polygon layer will be included in the output line layer, although these \\nlines will be truncated at the boundary of the overlay (Figure 7.9 \"Polygon-on-Line Overlay\"). For \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  178 \\nexample, a line-in-polygon overlay can take an input layer of interstate line segments and a polygon \\noverlay representing city boundaries and produce a linear output layer of highway segments that fall \\nwithin the city boundary. The attribute table for the output interstate line segment will contain \\ninformation on the interstate name as well as the city through which they pass. \\nFigure 7.8 Line-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe polygon-on-line overlay operation is the opposite of the line-in-polygon operation. In this case, the \\npolygon layer is the input, while the line layer is the overlay. The polygon featu res that overlay these lines \\nare selected and subsequently preserved in the output layer. For example, given a layer containing the \\npath of a series of telephone poles/wires and a polygon map contain city parcels, a polygon -on-line \\noverlay operation would allow a land assessor to select those parcels containing overhead telephone wires.  \\nFigure 7.9 Polygon-on-Line Overlay \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  179 \\nFinally, the polygon-in-polygon overlay operation employs a polygon input and a polygon overlay. This is \\nthe most commonly used overlay operation. Using this method, the polygon input and overlay layers are \\ncombined to create an output polygon layer with the extent of the overlay. The attribute table will contain \\nspatial data and attribute information from both the input and overlay layers ( Figure 7.10 \"Polygon-in-\\nPolygon Overlay\"). For example, you may choose an input polygon layer of soil types with an overlay of \\nagricultural fields within a given county. The output polygon layer would contain information on both the \\nlocation of agricultural fields and soil types throughout the county.  \\nFigure 7.10 Polygon-in-Polygon Overlay \\n \\nThe overlay operations discussed previously assume that the user desires the overlain layers to be \\ncombined. This is not always the case. Overlay methods can be more complex than that and therefore \\nemploy the basic Boolean operators: AND, OR, and XOR (see Section 6.1.2 \"Measures of Central \\nTendency\"). Depending on which operator(s) are utilized, the overlay method employed will result in an \\nintersection, union, symmetrical difference, or identity. \\nSpecifically, the union overlay method employs the OR operator. A union can be used only in the case of \\ntwo polygon input layers. It preserves all features, attribute information, and spatial extents from both \\ninput layers (part (a) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). This overlay method is based on the \\npolygon-in-polygon operation described in Section 7.1.1 \"Buffering\". \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  180 \\nAlternatively, the intersection overlay method employs the AND operator. An intersection requires a \\npolygon overlay, but can accept a point, line, or polygon input. The output layer covers the spatial extent \\nof the overlay and contains features and attributes from both the input and overlay (part (b) of Figure 7.11 \\n\"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nThe symmetrical difference overlay method employs the XOR operator, which results in the opposite \\noutput as an intersection. This method requires both input layers to be polygons. The output polygon \\nlayer produced by the symmetrical difference method represents those areas common to only one of the \\nfeature datasets (part (c) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). \\nIn addition to these simple operations, the identity (also referred to as \u201cminus\u201d) overlay method creates \\nan output layer with the spatial extent of the input layer (part (d) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \\n\") but includes attribute information from the overlay (referred to as the \u201cidentity\u201d layer, in this case). The \\ninput layer can be points, lines, or polygons. The identity layer must be a p olygon dataset. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  181 \\nFigure 7.11 Vector Overlay Methods \\n \\nOther Multilayer Geoprocessing Options \\nIn addition to the aforementioned vector overlay methods, other common multiple layer geoprocessing \\noptions are available to the user. These included the clip, erase, and split tools. The  clip geoprocessing \\noperation is used to extract those features from an input point, line, or polygon layer that falls within the \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  182 \\nspatial extent of the clip layer (part (e) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). Following the clip, all \\nattributes from the preserved portion of the input layer are included in the output. If any features are \\nselected during this process, only those selected features within the clip boundary will be included in the \\noutput. For example, the clip tool could be used to clip the extent of a river floodplain by the extent of a \\ncounty boundary. This would provide county managers with insight into which portions of the floodplain \\nthey are responsible to maintain. This is similar to the intersect overlay method; however, the attribute \\ninformation associated with the clip layer is not carried into the output layer following the overlay.  \\nThe erase geoprocessing operation is essentially the opposite of a clip. Whereas the clip tool preserves \\nareas within an input layer, the erase tool preserves only those areas outside the extent of the analogous \\nerase layer (part (f) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). While the input layer can be a point, line, or \\npolygon dataset, the erase layer must be a polygon dataset. Continuing with our clip example, county \\nmanagers could then use the erase tool to erase the areas of private ownership within the county \\nfloodplain area. Officials could then focus specifically on public reaches of the countywide floodplain for \\ntheir upkeep and maintenance responsibilities. \\nThe split geoprocessing operation is used to divide an input layer into two or more layers based on a split \\nlayer (part (g) of Figure 7.11 \"Vector Overlay Methods \"). The split layer must be a polygon, while the input \\nlayers can be point, line, or polygon. For example, a homeowner\u2019s association may choose to split up a \\ncountywide soil series map by parcel boundaries so each homeowner has a specific soil map for their own \\nparcel. \\nSpatial Join \\nA spatial join is a hybrid between an attribute operation and a vector overlay operation. Like the \u201cjoin\u201d \\nattribute operation described in Section 5.2.2 \"Joins and Relates\", a spatial join results in the combination \\nof two feature dataset tables by a common attribute field. Unlike the attribute operation, a spatial join \\ndetermines which fields from a source layer\u2019s attribute table are appended to the destination layer\u2019s \\nattribute table based on the relative locations of selected features. This relationship is explicitly based on \\nthe property of proximity or containment between the source and destination layers, rather than the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  183 \\nprimary or secondary keys. The proximity option is used when the source layer is a point or line feature \\ndataset, while the containment option is used when the source layer is a polygon feature dataset. \\nWhen employing the proximity (or \u201cnearest\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the closest given feature in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table. The \\nproximity option will typically add a numerical field to the destination layer attribute table, called \\n\u201cDistance,\u201d within which the measured distance between the source and destination feature is placed. For \\nexample, suppose a city agency had a point dataset showing all known polluters in town and a line dataset \\nof all the river segments within the municipal boundary. This agency could then perform a proximity -\\nbased spatial join to determine the nearest river segment that would most likely be affected by each \\npolluter. \\nWhen using the containment (or \u201cinside\u201d) option, a record for each feature in the polygon source layer\u2019s \\nattribute table is appended to the record in the destination layer\u2019s attribute table that it contains. If a \\ndestination layer feature (point, line, or polygon) is not completely contained within a source polygon, no \\nvalue will be appended. For example, suppose a pool cleaning business wanted to hone its marketing \\nservices by providing flyers only to homes that owned a pool. They could obtain a point dataset containing \\nthe location of every pool in the county and a polygon parcel map for that same area. That business could \\nthen conduct a spatial join to append the parcel information to the pool locales. This would provide them \\nwith information on the each land parcel that contained a pool and they could subsequently send their \\nmailers only to those homes. \\nOverlay Errors \\nAlthough overlays are one of the most important tools in a GIS analyst\u2019s toolbox, there are some problems \\nthat can arise when using this methodology. In particular, slivers are a common error produced when two \\nslightly misaligned vector layers are overlain (Figure 7.12 \"Slivers\"). This misalignment can come from \\nseveral sources including digitization errors, interpretation errors, or source map errors (Chang \\n2008). [1] For example, most vegetation and soil maps are created from field survey data, satellite images, \\nand aerial photography. While you can imagine that the boundaries of soils and vegetation frequently \\ncoincide, the fact that they were most likely created by different researchers at different times suggests Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  184 \\nthat their boundaries will not perfectly overlap. To ameliorate this problem, GIS software incorporates \\nacluster tolerance option that forces nearby lines to be snapped together if they fall within a user-specified \\ndistance. Care must be taken when assigning cluster tolerance. Too strict a setting will not snap shared \\nboundaries, while too lenient a setting will snap unintended, neighboring boundaries together (Wang and  \\nDonaghy 1995). [2] \\nFigure 7.12 Slivers \\n \\nA second potential source of error associated with the overlay process is error \\npropagation. Error propagation arises when inaccuracies are present in the original input and overlay \\nlayers and are propagated through to the output layer (MacDougall 1975).  [3] These errors can be related to \\npositional inaccuracies of the points, lines, or polygons. Alternatively, they can arise from attribute errors \\nin the original data table(s). Regardless of the source, error propagation represents a common problem in \\noverlay analysis, the impact of which depends largely on the accuracy and precision requirements of the \\nproject at hand. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, polygon-on-point, line-\\non-line, line-in-polygon, polygon-on-line, and polygon-in-polygon models. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  185 \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Raster data are particularly suited to certain \\ntypes of analyses, such as basic geoprocessing (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters\"), \\nsurface analysis (Section 8.2 \"Scale of Analysis\"), and terrain mapping (Section 8.3 \"Surface \\nAnalysis: Spatial Interpolation\"). While not always true, raster data can simplify many types of \\nspatial analyses that would otherwise be overly cumbersome to perform on vector datasets. Some of \\nthe most common of these techniques are presented in this chapter. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  187 \\n8.1 Basic Geoprocessing with Rasters \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to become familiar with basic single and multiple raster geoprocessing \\ntechniques. \\nLike the geoprocessing tools available for use on vector datasets (Section 8.1 \"Basic Geoprocessing \\nwith Rasters\"), raster data can undergo similar spatial operations. Although the actual computation \\nof these operations is significantly different from their vector counterparts, their conceptual \\nunderpinning is similar. The geoprocessing techniques covered here include both single layer \\n(Section 8.1.1 \"Single Layer Analysis\") and multiple layer (Section 8.1.2 \"Multiple Layer Analysis\") \\noperations. \\nSingle Layer Analysis \\nReclassifying, or recoding, a dataset is commonly one of the first steps undertaken during raster analysis. \\nReclassification is basically the single layer process of assigning a new class or range value to all pixels in \\nthe dataset based on their original values (Figure 8.1 \"Raster Reclassification\". For example, an elevation \\ngrid commonly contains a different value for nearly every cell within its extent. These values could be \\nsimplified by aggregating each pixel value in a few discrete classes (i.e., 0 \u2013100 = \u201c1,\u201d 101\u2013200 = \u201c2,\u201d 201\u2013\\n300 = \u201c3,\u201d etc.). This simplification allows for fewer unique values and cheaper storage requirements. In \\naddition, these reclassified layers are often used as inputs in secondary analyses, such as those discussed \\nlater in this section. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  188 \\nFigure 8.1 Raster Reclassification \\n \\nAs described in Chapter 7 \"Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations\", buffering is the process of creating \\nan output dataset that contains a zone (or zones) of a specified width around an input feature. In the case \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  189 \\nof raster datasets, these input features are given as a grid cell or a group of grid cells containing a uniform  \\nvalue (e.g., buffer all cells whose value = 1). Buffers are particularly suited for determining the area of \\ninfluence around features of interest. Whereas buffering vector data results in a precise area of influence \\nat a specified distance from the target feature, raster buffers tend to be approximations representing those \\ncells that are within the specified distance range of the target (Figure 8.2 \"Raster Buffer around a Target \\nCell(s)\"). Most geographic information system (GIS) programs calculate raster buffers by creating a grid \\nof distance values from the center of the target cell(s) to the center of the neighboring cells and then \\nreclassifying those distances such that a \u201c1\u201d represents those cells composing the original target, a \u201c2\u201d \\nrepresents those cells within the user-defined buffer area, and a \u201c0\u201d represents those cells outside of the \\ntarget and buffer areas. These cells could also be further classified to represent multiple ring buffers by \\nincluding values of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d \u201c5,\u201d and so forth, to represent concentric distances around the target cell(s). \\nFigure 8.2 Raster Buffer around a Target Cell(s) \\n \\nMultiple Layer Analysis \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  190 \\nA raster dataset can also be clipped similar to a vector dataset (Figure 8.3 \"Clipping a Raster to a Vector \\nPolygon Layer\"). Here, the input raster is overlain by a vector polygon clip layer. The raster clip process \\nresults in a single raster that is identical to the input raster but shares the extent of the polygon clip layer.  \\nFigure 8.3 Clipping a Raster to a Vector Polygon Layer \\n \\nRaster overlays are relatively simple compared to their vector counterparts and require much less \\ncomputational power (Burroughs 1983). [1] Despite their simplicity, it is important to ensure that all \\noverlain rasters are coregistered (i.e., spatially aligned), cover identical areas, and maintain equal \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  191 \\nresolution (i.e., cell size). If these assumptions are violated, the analysis will either fail or the resulting \\noutput layer will be flawed. With this in mind, there are several different methodologies for performing a \\nraster overlay (Chrisman 2002). [2] \\nThe mathematical raster overlay is the most common overlay method. The numbers within the aligned \\ncells of the input grids can undergo any user-specified mathematical transformation. Following the \\ncalculation, an output raster is produced that contains a new value for each cell ( Figure 8.4 \"Mathematical \\nRaster Overlay\"). As you can imagine, there are many uses for such functionality. In particular, raster \\noverlay is often used in risk assessment studies where various layers are combined to produce an outcome \\nmap showing areas of high risk/reward. \\nFigure 8.4 Mathematical Raster Overlay \\n \\nTwo input raster layers are overlain to produce an output raster with summed cell values. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  192 \\nThe Boolean raster overlay method represents a second powerful technique. As discussed in Chapter 6 \\n\"Data Characteristics and Visualization\", the Boolean connectors AND, OR, and XOR can be employed to \\ncombine the information of two overlying input raster datasets into a single output raste r. Similarly, the \\nrelational raster overlay method utilizes relational operators (<, <=, =, <>, >, and =>) to evaluate \\nconditions of the input raster datasets. In both the Boolean and relational overlay methods, cells that meet \\nthe evaluation criteria are typically coded in the output raster layer with a 1, while those evaluated as false \\nreceive a value of 0. \\nThe simplicity of this methodology, however, can also lead to easily overlooked errors in interpretation if \\nthe overlay is not designed properly. Assume that a natural resource manager has two input raster \\ndatasets she plans to overlay; one showing the location of trees (\u201c0\u201d = no tree; \u201c1\u201d = tree) and one showing \\nthe location of urban areas (\u201c0\u201d = not urban; \u201c1\u201d = urban). If she hopes to find the location of trees in \\nurban areas, a simple mathematical sum of these datasets will yield a \u201c2\u201d in all pixels containing a tree in \\nan urban area. Similarly, if she hopes to find the location of all treeless (or \u201cnon-tree,\u201d nonurban areas, \\nshe can examine the summed output raster for all \u201c0\u201d entries. Finally, if she hopes to locate urban, treeless \\nareas, she will look for all cells containing a \u201c1.\u201d Unfortunately, the cell value \u201c1\u201d also is coded into each \\npixel for nonurban, tree cells. Indeed, the choice of input pixel values and overlay equation in this \\nexample will yield confounding results due to the poorly devised overlay scheme.  \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Overlay processes place two or more thematic maps on top of one another to form a new map.  \\n\u2022 Overlay operations available for use with vector data include the point -in-polygon, line-in-polygon, or \\npolygon-in-polygon models. \\n\u2022 Union, intersection, symmetrical difference, and identity are common operations used to combine \\ninformation from various overlain datasets. \\n\u2022 Raster overlay operations can employ powerful mathematical, Boolean, or relational operators to create \\nnew output datasets. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

New York: John Wiley and Sons. \\n8.2 Scale of Analysis \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to understand how local, neighborhood, zonal, and global analyses can be \\napplied to raster datasets. \\nRaster analyses can be undertaken on four different scales of operation: local, neighborhood, zonal, \\nand global. Each of these presents unique options to the GIS analyst and are presented here in this \\nsection. \\nLocal Operations \\nLocal operations can be performed on single or multiple rasters. When used on a single raster, a local \\noperation usually takes the form of applying some mathematical transformation to each individual cell in \\nthe grid. For example, a researcher may obtain a digital elevation model (DEM) with each cell value \\nrepresenting elevation in feet. If it is preferred to represent those elevations in meters, a simple, \\narithmetic transformation (original elevation in feet * 0.3048 = new elevation in meters) of each cell value \\ncan be performed locally to accomplish this task. \\nWhen applied to multiple rasters, it becomes possible to perform such analyses as changes over time. \\nGiven two rasters containing information on groundwater depth on a parcel of land at Year 2000 and \\nYear 2010, it is simple to subtract these values and place the difference in an output raster that will note \\nthe change in groundwater between those two times (Figure 8.5 \"Local Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nThese local analyses can become somewhat more complicated however, as the number  of input rasters \\nincrease. For example, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) applies a local mathematical formula to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  194 \\nseveral overlying rasters including rainfall intensity, erodibility of the soil, slope, cultivation type, and \\nvegetation type to determine the average soil loss (in tons) in a grid cell. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  195 \\nFigure 8.5 Local Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nNeighborhood Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  196 \\nTobler\u2019s first law of geography states that \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are \\nmore related than distant things.\u201d Neighborhood operations represent a group of frequently used spatial \\nanalysis techniques that rely heavily on this concept. Neighborhood functions examine the relationship of \\nan object with similar surrounding objects. They can be performed on point, line, or polygon vector \\ndatasets as well as on raster datasets. In the case of vector datasets, neighborhood analysis is most \\nfrequently used to perform basic searches. For example, given a point dataset co ntaining the location of \\nconvenience stores, a GIS could be employed to determine the number of stores within 5 miles of a linear \\nfeature (i.e., Interstate 10 in California). \\nNeighborhood analyses are often more sophisticated when used with raster datasets. Raster analyses \\nemploy moving windows, also called filters or kernels, to calculate new cell values for every location \\nthroughout the raster layer\u2019s extent. These moving windows can take many different forms depending on \\nthe type of output desired and the phenomena being examined. For example, a rectangular, 3-by-3 \\nmoving window is commonly used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum, maximum, \\nor range of values immediately surrounding a given \u201ctarget\u201d cell (Figure 8.6 \"Common Neighborhood \\nTypes around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). Thetarget cell is that cell \\nfound in the center of the 3-by-3 moving window. The moving window passes over every cell in the raster. \\nAs it passes each central target cell, the nine values in the 3-by-3 window are used to calculate a new value \\nfor that target cell. This new value is placed in the identical location in the output raster. If one wanted to \\nexamine a larger sphere of influence around the target cells, the moving wi ndow could be expanded to 5 \\nby 5, 7 by 7, and so forth. Additionally, the moving window need not be a simple rectangle. Other shapes \\nused to calculate neighborhood statistics include the annulus, wedge, and circle ( Figure 8.6 \"Common \\nNeighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, (d) Wedge\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  197 \\nFigure 8.6 Common Neighborhood Types around Target Cell \u201cx\u201d: (a) 3 by 3, (b) Circle, (c) Annulus, \\n(d) Wedge \\n \\nNeighborhood operations are commonly used for data simplification on rast er datasets. An analysis that \\naverages neighborhood values would result in a smoothed output raster with dampened highs and lows as \\nthe influence of the outlying data values are reduced by the averaging process. Alternatively, \\nneighborhood analyses can be used to exaggerate differences in a dataset. Edge enhancement is a type of \\nneighborhood analysis that examines the range of values in the moving window. A large range value \\nwould indicate that an edge occurs within the extent of the window, while a small r ange indicates the lack \\nof an edge. \\nZonal Operations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  198 \\nA zonal operation is employed on groups of cells of similar value or like features, not surprisingly called \\nzones (e.g., land parcels, political/municipal units, waterbodies, soil/vegetation types). Thes e zones could \\nbe conceptualized as raster versions of polygons. Zonal rasters are often created by reclassifying an input \\nraster into just a few categories (see Section 8.2.2 \"Neighborhood Operations\" ). Zonal operations may be \\napplied to a single raster or two overlaying rasters. Given a single input raster, zonal operations measure \\nthe geometry of each zone in the raster, such as area, perimeter, thickness, and centroid. Given two rasters \\nin a zonal operation, one input raster and one zonal raster, a zonal operation produces an output raster, \\nwhich summarizes the cell values in the input raster for each zone in the zonal raster ( Figure 8.7 \"Zonal \\nOperation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.7 Zonal Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\nZonal operations and analyses are valuable in fields of study such as landscape ecology where the \\ngeometry and spatial arrangement of habitat patches can significantly affect the type and number of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  199 \\nspecies that can reside in them. Similarly, zonal analyses can effectively quantify the narrow habitat \\ncorridors that are important for regional movement of flightless, migratory animal species moving \\nthrough otherwise densely urbanized areas. \\nGlobal Operations \\nGlobal operations are similar to zonal operations whereby the entire raster dataset\u2019s extent represents a \\nsingle zone. Typical global operations include determining basic statistical values for the raster as a whole. \\nFor example, the minimum, maximum, average, range, and so forth can be quickly calculated over th e \\nentire extent of the input raster and subsequently be output to a raster in which every cell contains that \\ncalculated value (Figure 8.8 \"Global Operation on a Raster Dataset\"). \\nFigure 8.8 Global Operation on a Raster Dataset \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  200 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Local raster operations examine only a single target cell during analysis.  \\n\u2022 Neighborhood raster operations examine the relationship of a target cell proximal surrounding cells.  \\n\u2022 Zonal raster operations examine groups of cells that occur within a uniform feature type.  \\n\u2022 Global raster operations examine the entire areal extent of the dataset.  \\nEXERCISE \\n1.

The objective of this section is to become familiar with concepts and terms related to GIS surfaces, how to \\ncreate them, and how they are used to answer specific spatial questions.  \\nA surface is a vector or raster dataset that contains an attribute value for every locale throughout its \\nextent. In a sense, all raster datasets are surfaces, but not all vector datasets are surfaces. Surfaces \\nare commonly used in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize phenomena such as \\nelevation, temperature, slope, aspect, rainfall, and more. In a GIS, surface analyses are usually \\ncarried out on either raster datasets or TINs (Triangular Irregular Network; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial \\nData Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File Formats\"), but isolines or point arrays can also be \\nused. Interpolation is used to estimate the value of a variable at an unsampled location from \\nmeasurements made at nearby or neighboring locales. Spatial interpolation methods draw on the \\ntheoretical creed of Tobler\u2019s first law of geography, which states that \u201ceverything is related to \\neverything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d Indeed, this basic tenet \\nof positive spatial autocorrelation forms the backbone of many spatial analyses (Figure 8.9 \"Positive \\nand Negative Spatial Autocorrelation\"). \\nFigure 8.9 Positive and Negative Spatial Autocorrelation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  202 \\nCreating Surfaces \\nThe ability to create a surface is a valuable tool in a GIS. The creation of raster surfaces, however, often \\nstarts with the creation of a vector surface. One common method to create such a vector surface from \\npoint data is via the generation of Thiessen (or Voronoi) polygons. Thiessen polygons are mathematically \\ngenerated areas that define the sphere of influence around each point in the dataset relative to all other \\npoints (Figure 8.10 \"A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons\" ). Specifically, polygon \\nboundaries are calculated as the perpendicular bisectors of the lines between e ach pair of neighboring \\npoints. The derived Thiessen polygons can then be used as crude vector surfaces that provide attribute \\ninformation across the entire area of interest. A common example of Thiessen polygons is the creation of a \\nrainfall surface from an array of rain gauge point locations. Employing some basic reclassification \\ntechniques, these Thiessen polygons can be easily converted to equivalent raster representations.  \\nFigure 8.10 A Vector Surface Created Using Thiessen Polygons \\n \\nWhile the creation of Thiessen polygons results in a polygon layer whereby each polygon, or raster zone, \\nmaintains a single value, interpolation is a potentially complex statistical technique that estimates the \\nvalue of all unknown points between the known points. The three basic methods used to create \\ninterpolated surfaces are spline, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and trend surface. The spline \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  203 \\ninterpolation method forces a smoothed curve through the set of known input points to estimate the \\nunknown, intervening values. IDW interpolation estimates the values of unknown locations using the \\ndistance to proximal, known values. The weight placed on the value of each proximal value is in inverse \\nproportion to its spatial distance from the target locale. Therefore, the farther the proximal point, the less \\nweight it carries in defining the target point\u2019s value. Finally, trend surface interpolation is the most \\ncomplex method as it fits a multivariate statistical regression model to the known points, assigning a value \\nto each unknown location based on that model. \\nOther highly complex interpolation methods exist such as kriging. Kriging is a complex geostatistical \\ntechnique, similar to IDW, that employs semivariograms to interpolate the values of an input point layer \\nand is more akin to a regression analysis (Krige 1951). [1] The specifics of the kriging methodology will not \\nbe covered here as this is beyond the scope of this text. For more information on kriging, consult review \\ntexts such as Stein (1999). [2] \\nInversely, raster data can also be used to create vector surfaces. For instance, isoline maps are made up of \\ncontinuous, nonoverlapping lines that connect points of equal value. Isolines have specific monikers \\ndepending on the type of information they model (e.g., elevation = contour lines, temperature = \\nisotherms, barometric pressure = isobars, wind speed = isotachs) Figure 8.11 \"Contour Lines Derived \\nfrom a DEM\" shows an isoline elevation map. As the elevation values of this digital elevation model \\n(DEM) range from 450 to 950 feet, the contour lines are placed at 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 feet \\nelevations throughout the extent of the image. In this example, the contour interval, defined as the vertical \\ndistance between each contour line, is 100 feet. The contour interval is determined by the user during the \\ncreating of the surface. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  204 \\nFigure 8.11 Contour Lines Derived from a DEM \\n \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Spatial interpolation is used to estimate those unknown values found between known data points.  \\n\u2022 Spatial autocorrelation is positive when mapped features are clustered and is negative when mapped \\nfeatures are uniformly distributed. \\n\u2022 Thiessen polygons are a valuable tool for converting point arrays into polygon surfaces.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to learn to apply basic raster surface analyses to terrain mapping \\napplications. \\nSurface analysis is often referred to as terrain (elevation) analysis when information related to slope, \\naspect, viewshed, hydrology, volume, and so forth are calculated on raster surfaces such as DEMs \\n(digital elevation models; Chapter 5 \"Geospatial Data Management\", Section 5.3.1 \"Vector File \\nFormats\"). In addition, surface analysis techniques can also be applied to more esoteric mapping \\nefforts such as probability of tornados or concentration of infant mortalities in a given region. In this \\nsection we discuss a few methods for creating surfaces and common surface analysis techniques \\nrelated to terrain datasets. \\nSeveral common raster-based neighborhood analyses provide valuable insights into the surface \\nproperties of terrain. Slope maps (part (a) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") are excellent for analyzing and visualizing landform characteristics and are \\nfrequently used in conjunction with aspect maps (defined later) to assess watershed units, inventory \\nforest resources, determine habitat suitability, estimate slope erosion potential, and so forth. They \\nare typically created by fitting a planar surface to a 3-by-3 moving window around each target cell. \\nWhen dividing the horizontal distance across the moving window (which is determined via the \\nspatial resolution of the raster image) by the vertical distance within the window (measure as the \\ndifference between the largest cell value and the central cell value), the slope is relatively easily \\nobtained. The output raster of slope values can be calculated as either percent slope or degree of \\nslope. \\nAny cell that exhibits a slope must, by definition, be oriented in a known direction. This orientation \\nis referred to as aspect. Aspect maps (part (b) ofFigure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\") use slope information to produce output raster images whereby the value of each \\ncell denotes the direction it faces. This is usually coded as either one of the eight ordinal directions \\n(north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) or in degrees from 1\u00b0 (nearly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  206 \\ndue north) to 360\u00b0 (back to due north). Flat surfaces have no aspect and are given a value of \u22121. To \\ncalculate aspect, a 3-by-3 moving window is used to find the highest and lowest elevations around \\nthe target cell. If the highest cell value is located at the top-left of the window (\u201ctop\u201d being due north) \\nand the lowest value is at the bottom-right, it can be assumed that the aspect is southeast. The \\ncombination of slope and aspect information is of great value to researchers such as botanists and \\nsoil scientists because sunlight availability varies widely between north-facing and south-facing \\nslopes. Indeed, the various light and moisture regimes resulting from aspect changes encourage \\nvegetative and edaphic differences. \\nA hillshade map (part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps\") \\nrepresents the illumination of a surface from some hypothetical, user-defined light source \\n(presumably, the sun). Indeed, the slope of a hill is relatively brightly lit when facing the sun and \\ndark when facing away. Using the surface slope, aspect, angle of incoming light, and solar altitude as \\ninputs, the hillshade process codes each cell in the output raster with an 8-bit value (0\u2013255) \\nincreasing from black to white. As you can see in part (c) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c \\nand d) Hillshade Maps\", hillshade representations are an effective way to visualize the three-\\ndimensional nature of land elevations on a two-dimensional monitor or paper map. Hillshade maps \\ncan also be used effectively as a baseline map when overlain with a semitransparent layer, such as a \\nfalse-color digital elevation model (DEM; part (d) of Figure 8.12 \"(a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) \\nHillshade Maps\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  207 \\nFigure 8.12 (a) Slope, (b) Aspect, and (c and d) Hillshade Maps \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nViewshed analysis is a valuable visualization technique that uses the elevation value of cells in a DEM \\nor TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) to determine those areas that can be seen from one or more \\nspecific location(s) (part (a) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed Maps\"). The viewing \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  208 \\nlocation can be either a point or line layer and can be placed at any desired elevation. The output of \\nthe viewshed analysis is a binary raster that classifies cells as either 1 (visible) or 0 (not visible). In \\nthe case of two viewing locations, the output raster values would be 2 (visible from both points), 1 \\n(visible from one point), or 0 (not visible from either point). \\nAdditional parameters influencing the resultant viewshed map are the viewing azimuth (horizontal \\nand/or vertical) and viewing radius. The horizontal viewing azimuth is the horizontal angle of the \\nview area and is set to a default value of 360\u00b0. The user may want to change this value to 90\u00b0 if, for \\nexample, the desired viewshed included only the area that could be seen from an office window. \\nSimilarly, vertical viewing angle can be set from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. Finally, the viewing radius determines \\nthe distance from the viewing location that is to be included in the output. This parameter is \\nnormally set to infinity (functionally, this includes all areas within the DEM or TIN under \\nexamination). It may be decreased if, for instance, you only wanted to include the area within the 100 \\nkm broadcast range of a radio station. \\nSimilarly, watershed analyses are a series of surface analysis techniques that define the topographic \\ndivides that drain surface water for stream networks (part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) \\nWatershed Maps\"). In geographic information systems (GISs), a watershed analysis is based on input \\nof a \u201cfilled\u201d DEM. A filled DEM is one that contains no internal depressions (such as would be seen \\nin a pothole, sink wetland, or quarry). From these inputs, a flow direction raster is created to model \\nthe direction of water movement across the surface. From the flow direction information, a flow \\naccumulation raster calculates the number of cells that contribute flow to each cell. Generally \\nspeaking, cells with a high value of flow accumulation represent stream channels, while cells with \\nlow flow accumulation represent uplands. With this in mind, a network of rasterized stream \\nsegments is created. These stream networks are based on some user-defined minimum threshold of \\nflow accumulation. For example, it may be decided that a cell needs at least one thousand \\ncontributing cells to be considered a stream segment. Altering this threshold value will change the \\ndensity of the stream network. Following the creation of the stream network, a stream link raster is \\ncalculated whereby each stream segment (line) is topologically connected to stream intersections \\n(nodes). Finally, the flow direction and stream link raster datasets are combined to determine the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  209 \\noutput watershed raster as seen in part (b) of Figure 8.13 \"(a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed \\nMaps\" (Chang 2008). [1] Such analyses are invaluable for watershed management and hydrologic \\nmodeling. \\nFigure 8.13 (a) Viewshed and (b) Watershed Maps \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAY \\n\u2022 Nearest neighborhood functions are frequently used to on raster surfaces to create slope, aspect, \\nhillshade, viewshed, and watershed maps. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

This chapter is concerned less with the \\ncomputational options available to the GIS user and more with the artistic options. In essence, this \\nchapter shifts the focus away from GIS tools and toward cartographic tools, although the two are \\nbecoming more and more inextricably bound. Unfortunately, many GIS users are never exposed to \\nthe field of cartography. In these cases, the hard work of creating, maintaining, aligning, and \\nanalyzing complex spatial datasets are not truly appreciated as the final mapping product may not \\nadequately communicate this information to the consumer. In addition, maps, like statistics, can be \\nused to distort information, as illustrated by Mark Monmonier\u2019s (1996) [1] book titled How to Lie with \\nMaps. Indeed, a strong working knowledge of cartographic rules will not only assist in the avoidance \\nof potential misrepresentation of spatial information but also enhance one\u2019s ability to identify these \\nindiscretions in other cartographers\u2019 creations. The cartographic principles discussed herein are laid \\nout to guide GIS users through the process of transforming accumulated bits of GIS data into \\nattractive, useful maps for print and display. This discussion specifically addresses the intricacies of \\neffective color usage (Section 9.1 \"Color\"), symbol selection (Section 9.2 \"Symbology\"), and map \\nlayout and design (Section 9.3 \"Cartographic Design\"). \\n \\n[1] Monmonier, M. 1996.

The objective of this section is to gain an understanding the properties of color and how best to utilize \\nthem in your cartographic products. \\nAlthough a high-quality map is composed of many different elements, color is one of the first \\ncomponents noticed by end-users. This is partially due to the fact that we each have an intuitive \\nunderstanding of how colors are, and should be, used to create an effective and pleasing visual \\nexperience. Nevertheless, it is not always clear to the map-maker which colors should be used to best \\nconvey the purpose of the product. This intuition is much like listening to our favorite music. We \\nknow when a note is in tune or out of tune, but we wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any idea of how to fix a \\nbad note. Color is indeed a tricky piece of the cartographic puzzle and is not surprisingly the most \\nfrequently criticized variable on computer-generated maps (Monmonier 1996). [1] This section \\nattempts to outline the basic components of color and the guidelines to most effectively employ this \\nimportant map attribute. \\nColor Basics \\nAs electromagnetic radiation (ER) travels via waves from the sun (or a lightbulb) to objects on the earth, \\nportions of the ER spectrum are absorbed, scattered, or reflected by various objects. The resulting \\nproperty of the absorbed, scattered, and reflected ER is termed \u201ccolor.\u201d White is the color resulting from \\nthe full range of the visual spectrum and is therefore considered the benchmark color by which all others \\nare measured. Black is the absence of ER. All other colors result from a partial interaction with the ER \\nspectrum. \\nThe three primary aspects of color that must be addressed in map making are hue, value, and \\nsaturation. Hue is the dominant wavelength or color associated with a reflecting object. Hue is the most \\nbasic component of color and includes red, blue, yellow, purple, and so forth.  Value is the amount of white \\nor black in the color. Value is often synonymous with contrast. Variations in the amount of value for a \\ngiven hue result in varying degrees of lightness or darkness for that color. Lighter colors are said to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  212 \\npossess high value, while dark colors possess low value. Monochrome colors are groups of colors with the \\nsame hue but with incremental variations in value. As seen in , variations in value will typically lead the \\nviewer\u2019s eye from dark areas to light areas. \\nFigure 9.1 Value \\n \\nSaturation describes the intensity of color. Full saturation results in pure colors, while low saturation \\ncolors approach gray. Variations in saturation yield different shades and tints.  Shades are produced by \\nblocking light, such as by an umbrella, tree, curtain, and so forth. Increasing the amount of shading \\nresults in grays and blacks. Tint is the opposite of shade and is produced by adding white to a color. Tints \\nand shades are particularly germane when using additive color models (see for more on additive color \\nmodels). To maximize the interpretability of a map, use saturated colors to represent hierarchically \\nprominent features and washed-out colors to represent background features. \\nIf used properly, color can greatly enhance and support map design. Likewise, color can detract from a \\nmapping product if abused. To use color properly, one must first consider the purpose of the map. In \\nsome cases, the use of color is not warranted. Grayscale maps can be just as effective as color maps if the \\nsubject matter merits it. Regardless, there are many reasons to use color. The five primary reasons are \\noutlined here. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  213 \\nColor is particularly suited to convey meaning (). For example, red is a strong color that evokes a \\npassionate response in humans. Red has been shown to evoke physiological responses such as increasing \\nthe rate of respiration and raising blood pressure. Red is frequently associated with blood , war, violence, \\neven love. On the other hand, blue is a color associated with calming effects. Associated with the sky or \\nocean, blue colors can actually assist in sleep and is therefore a recommended color for bedrooms. Too \\nmuch blue, however, can result in a lapse from calming effects into feelings of depression (i.e., having the \\n\u201cblues\u201d). Green is most commonly associated with life or nature (plants). The color green is certainly one \\nof the most topical colors in today\u2019s society with commonplace references to green construction, the Green \\nparty, going green, and so forth. Green, however, can also represent envy and inexperience (e.g., the \\ngreen-eyed monster, greenhorn). Brown is also a nature color but more as a representation of earth and \\nstone. Brown can also imply dullness. Yellow is most commonly associated with sunshine and warmth, \\nsomewhat similar to red. Yellow can also represent cowardice (e.g., yellow -bellied). Black, the absence of \\ncolor, is possibly the most meaning-laden color in modern parlance. Even more than the others, the color \\nblack purports surprisingly strong positive and negative connotations. Black conveys mystery, elegance, \\nand sophistication (e.g., a black-tie affair, in the black), while also conveying loss, evil, and negativity (e .g., \\nblackout, black-hearted, black cloud, blacklist). \\nFigure 9.2 Use of Color to Provide Meaning \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  214 \\nIn this map, red counties are those that voted for the Republican Party in the 2004 presidential \\nelection, while blue counties voted Democrat. These colors are typically used to designate the \\nDemocratic and Republican Parties. \\nThe second reason to use color is for clarification and emphasis (). Warm colors, such as reds and yellows, \\nare notable for emphasizing spatial features. These colors will often jump of f the page and are usually the \\nfirst to attract the reader\u2019s eye, particularly if they are counterbalanced with cool colors, such as blues and \\ngreens (see for more on warm and cool colors). In addition, the use of a hue with high saturation will \\nstand out starkly against similar hues of low saturation. \\nFigure 9.3 Use of Color to Provide Emphasis \\n \\nRed marks the spot! \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  215 \\nColor use is also important for creating a map with pleasing aesthetics (). Certainly, one of the most \\nchallenging aspects of map creation is developing an effective color palette. When looking at maps \\nthrough an aesthetic lens, we are truly starting to think of our creations as artwork. Although somewhat \\nparticular to individual viewers, we all have an innate understanding of when colors in a g raphic/art are \\naesthetically pleasing and when they are not. For example, color use is considered harmonious when \\ncolors from opposite sides of the color wheel are used (), whereas equitable use of several major hues can \\ncreate an unbalanced image. \\nFigure 9.4 Use of Color to Provide Aesthetics \\n \\nThe fourth use of color is abstraction (). Color abstraction is an effective way to illustrate quantitative and \\nqualitative data, particularly for thematic products such as choropleth maps. Here, colors are used sol ely \\nto denote different values for a variable and may not have any particular rhyme or reason.  shows a typical \\nthematic map with abstract colors representing different countries.  \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  216 \\nFigure 9.5 Use of Color to Provide Abstraction \\n \\nOpposite abstraction, color can also be used to represent reality (). Maps showing elevation (e.g., digital \\nelevation models or DEMs) are often given false colors that approximate reality. Low areas are colored in \\nvariations of green to show areas of lush vegetation growth. Mid-elevations (or low-lying desert areas) are \\ncolored brown to show sparse vegetation growth. Mountain ridges and peaks are colored white to show \\naccumulated snowfall. Watercourses and water bodies are colored blue. Unless there is a specific reason \\nnot to, natural phenomena represented on maps should always be colored to approximate their actual \\ncolor to increase interpretability and to decrease confusion. \\n  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  217 \\nFigure 9.6 \\n3\\n \\nGreens, blues, and browns are used to imitate real-world phenomena. \\nColor Models \\nColor models are systems that allow for the creation of a range of colors from a short list of primary \\ncolors. Color models can be additive or subtractive. Additive color models combine emitted light to \\ndisplay color variations and are commonly used with computer monitors, televisions, scanners, digital \\ncameras, and video projectors. The RGB (red-green-blue) color model is the most common additive model \\n(part (a) of ). The RGB model combines light beams of the primary hues of red, green, and blue to yield \\nadditive secondary hues of magenta, cyan, and yellow. Although there is a substantive difference between \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  218 \\npure yellow light (~580 nm) and a mixture of green and red light, the human eye perceives these signals \\nas the same. The RGB model typically employs three 8-bit numeric values (called an RGB triplet) ranging \\nfrom 0 to 255 to model colors. For instance, the RGB triplets for the pure primary and secondary colors \\nare as follows: \\n\u2022 Red = (255, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 Green = (0, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Blue = (0, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Magenta = (255, 0, 255) \\n\u2022 Cyan = (0, 255, 255) \\n\u2022 Yellow = (255, 255, 0) \\n\u2022 Black, the absence of additive color = (0, 0, 0) \\n\u2022 White, the sum of all additive color = (255, 255, 255) \\nTwo other common additive color models, based on the RGB model, are the HSL  (hue, saturation, \\nlightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, value) models (, b and c). These models are based on cylindrical \\ncoordinate systems whereby the angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to the hue; the \\ndistance from the central axis corresponds to saturation; and the distance along the central axis \\ncorresponds to either saturation or lightness. Because of their basis in the RGB model, both the HSL and \\nHSV color models can be directly transformed between the three additive models. While these relatively \\nsimple additive models provide minimal computer-processing time, they do possess the disadvantage of \\nglossing over some of the complexities of color. For example, the RGB color model does not define \\n\u201cabsolute\u201d color spaces, which connotes that these hues may look differently when viewed on different \\ndisplays. Also, the RGB hues are not evenly spaced along the color spectrum, meaning combinations of \\nthe hues is less than exact. \\nFigure 9.7 Additive Color Models: (a) RGB, (b) HSL, and (c) HSV \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  219 \\nIn contrast to an additive model, subtractive color models involve the mixing of paints, dyes, or inks to \\ncreate full color ranges. These subtractive models display color on the assumption that white, ambient \\nlight is being scattered, absorbed, and reflected from the page by the pri nting inks. Subtractive models \\ntherefore create white by restricting ink from the print surface. As such, these models assume the use of \\nwhite paper as other paper colors will result in skewed hues. CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is the \\nmost common subtractive color model and is occasionally referred to as a \u201cfour-color process\u201d (). \\nAlthough the CMY inks are sufficient to create all of the colors of the subtractive rainbow, a black ink is \\nincluded in this model as it is much cheaper than using a CMY mix for all blacks (black being the most \\ncommonly printed color) and because combining CMY often results in more of a dark brown hue. The \\nCMYK model creates color values by entering percentages for each of the four colors ranging from 0 \\npercent to 100 percent. For example, pure red is composed of 14 percent cyan, 100 percent magenta, 99 \\npercent yellow, and 3 percent black. \\nAs you may guess, additive models are the preferred choice when maps are to be displayed on a computer \\nmonitor, while subtractive models are preferred when printing. If in doubt, it is usually best to use the \\nRGB model as this supports a larger percentage of the visible spectrum in comparison with the CMYK \\nmodel. Once an image is converted from RGB to CMYK, the additional RGB information is irretrievably \\nlost. If possible, collecting both RGB and CMYK versions of an image is ideal, particularly if your graphic \\nis to be both printed and placed online. One last note, you will also want to be selective in your use of file \\nformats for these color models. The JPEG and GIF graphic file formats are the best choice for RGB \\nimages, while the EPS and TIFF graphic file formats are preferred with printed CMYK images.  \\nFigure 9.8 Subtractive Color Model: CMYK \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  220 \\nColor Choices \\nEffective color usage requires a modicum of knowledge about the color wheel. Invented by Sir Isaac \\nNewton in 1706, the color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic \\nrelationships. Primary hues are equidistant from each other with secondary and tertiary colors \\nintervening. The red-yellow-blue color wheel is the most frequently used (); however, the magenta -yellow-\\ncyan wheel is the preferred choice of print makers (for reasons described in the previous section). Primary \\ncolors are those that cannot be created by mixing other colors; secondary colors are defined as those \\ncolors created by mixing two primary hues; tertiary colors are those created by mixing primary and \\nsecondary hues. Furthermore, complementary colors are those placed opposite each on t he wheel, while \\nanalogous colors are located proximal to each other. Complementary colors emphasize differences. \\nAnalogues suggest harmony. \\nFigure 9.9 Color Wheel Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  221 \\n \\nColors can be further referred to as warm or cool (). Warm colors are those that might be seen during a \\nbright, sunny day. Cool colors are those associated with overcast days. Warm colors are typified by hues \\nranging from red to yellow, including browns and tans. Cool color hues range from blue -green through \\nblue-violet and include the majority of gray variants. When used in mapping, it is wise to use warm and \\ncool colors with care. Indeed, warm colors stand out, appear active, and stimulate the viewer. Cool colors \\nappear small, recede, and calm the viewer. As you might guess, it is important th at you apply warm colors \\nto the map features of primary interest, while using cool colors on the secondary, background, and/or \\ncontextual features. \\nFigure 9.10 Warm (Orange) and Cool (Blue) Colors \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  222 \\n \\nNote that the warm color stands out, while the cool color recedes. \\nIn light of the plethora of color schemes and options available, it is wise to follow some basic color usage \\nguidelines. For example, changes in hue are best suited to visualizing qualitative data, while changes in \\nvalue and saturation are effective at visualizing quantitative data. Likewise, variations in lightness and \\nsaturation are best suited to representing ordered data since these establish hierarchy among features. In \\nparticular, a monochromatic color scale is an effective way to represent the order of data whereby light \\ncolors represent smaller data values and dark colors represent larger values. Keep in mind that it is best to \\nuse more light shades than dark ones as the human eye can better discern lighter shades. Also, the \\nnumber of coincident colors that can be distinguished by humans is around seven, so be careful not to \\nabuse the color palette in your maps. If the data being mapped has a zero point, a dichromatic scale () \\nprovides a natural breaking point with increasing color values on each end of the scale representing \\nincreasing data values. \\nFigure 9.11 \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  223 \\n \\nA dichromatic scale is essentially two monochromatic scales joined by a low color value in the \\ncenter. \\nIn addition, darker colors result in more important or pronounced graphic featu res (assuming the \\nbackground is not overly dark). Use dark colors on features whose visual impact you wish to magnify. \\nFinally, do not use all the colors of the spectrum in a single map. It is best to leave such messy, rainbow -\\nspectacular effects to the late Jackson Pollock and his abstract expressionist ilk. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Colors are defined by their hue, value, saturation, shade, and tint. \\n\u2022 Colors are used to convey meaning, clarification and emphasis, aesthetics, abstraction, and reality.  \\n\u2022 Color models can be additive (e.g., RGB) or subtractive (e.g., CMYK). \\n\u2022 The color wheel is a powerful tool that assists in the selection of colors for your cartographic products.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

The objective of this section is to understand how to best utilize point, line, and polygon symbols to assist \\nin the interpretation of your map and its features. \\nWhile color is an integral variable when choosing how to best represent spatial data, making \\ninformed decisions on the size, shape, and type of symbols is equally important. Although raster data \\nare restricted to symbolizing features as a single cell or as cell groupings, vector data allows for a vast \\narray of options to symbolize points, lines, and polygons in a map. Like color, cartographers must \\ntake care to use symbols judiciously in order to most effectively communicate the meaning and \\npurpose of the map to the viewer. \\nBasic Symbol Guidelines \\nVector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a myriad of ways. The guidelines laid out in this \\nsection will help you to make informed decisions on how best to represent the features in your map. The \\nprimary visual variables associated with symbolization include size, texture, pattern, and shape ( Figure \\n9.12 \"Visual Variables\"). Changes to symbol size and texture are most effectively used in conjunction with \\nordinal, interval, and ratio data. Changes to symbol pattern and shape are preferred in conjunction with \\nnominal data. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  225 \\nFigure 9.12 Visual Variables \\n \\nVariations in the size of symbols are powerful indicators of feature importance. Intuitively, larger symbols \\nare assumed to be more important than smaller symbols. Although symbol size is most commonly \\nassociated with point features, linear symbols can effectively be altered in size by adjusting line width. \\nPolygon features can also benefit from resizing. Despite the fact that the area of the polygon can\u2019t be \\nchanged, a point representing the centroid of the polygon can be included in the map. These polygon \\ncentroids can be resized and symbolized as desired, just like any other point feature. Varying symbol size \\nis moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is ineffective with nominal data.  \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  226 \\nSymbol texture, also referred to as spacing, refers to the compactness of the marks that make up the \\nsymbol. Points, lines, and polygons can be filled with horizontal hash marks, for instance. The closer these \\nhash marks are spaced within the feature symbol, the more hierarchically important the feature will \\nappear. Varying symbol texture is most effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data but is \\nineffective with nominal data. \\nMuch like texture, symbols can be filled with different patterns. These patterns are typically some artistic \\nabstraction that may or may not attempt to visualize real-world phenomena. For example, a land-use map \\nmay change the observed fill patterns of various land types to try to depict the dominant plants associated \\nwith each vegetation community. Changes to symbol patterns are most often associated with polygon \\nfeatures, although there is some limited utility in changing the fill patterns of points and lines. Varying \\nsymbol size is moderately effective when applied to ordinal or numerical data and is ineffective when \\napplied to nominal data. \\nAltering symbol shape can have dramatic effects on the appearance of map features. Point symbols are \\nmost commonly symbolized with circles. Circles tend to be the default point symbol due to their \\nunchanging orientation, compact shape, and viewer preference. Other geometric shapes can also \\nconstitute effective symbols due to their visual stability and conservation of map space. Unless specific \\nconditions allow, volumetric symbols (spheres, cubes, etc.) should be used sparingly as they rarely \\ncontribute more than simple, two-dimensional symbols. In addition to geometric symbols, pictograms are \\nuseful representations of point features and can help to add artistic flair to a map. Pictograms should \\nclearly denote features of interest and should not require interpretation by the viewer ( Figure 9.13 \\n\"Pictograms\"). Locales that frequently employ pictograms include picnic areas, camping sites, road signs, \\nbathrooms, airports, and so forth. Varying symbol shape is most effective when applied to nominal data \\nand is moderately effective with ordinal and nominal data. \\nFinally, applying variations in lightness/darkness will affect the hierarchical value of a symbol. The darker \\nthe symbol, the more it stands out among lighter features. Variations in the lightness/darkness of a \\nsymbol are most effective when applied to ordinal data, are moderately effective when applied to \\nnumerical data, and are ineffective when applied to nominal data.  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  227 \\nFigure 9.13 Pictograms \\n \\nKeep in mind that there are many other visual variables that can be employed in a map, depending on the \\ncartographic software used. Regardless of the chosen symbology, it is important to maintain a logical \\nrelationship between the symbol and the data. Also, visual contrast between different mapped variables \\nmust be preserved. Indeed, the efficacy of your map will be greatly diminished if you do not ensure that its \\nsymbols are readily identifiable and look markedly different from each other.  \\nProportional Symbolization \\nIn addition to the uniform symbols presented in the previous section, symbols for a single, q uantitative \\nvariable can be sized proportionally to match the data values. These proportional symbols are useful for \\npresenting a fairly exact understanding of the differences in magnitude within a dataset. As the numeric \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  228 \\nvalues for each class increases, so too does the size of the symbol representing that class. This allows the \\nsymbol size of features to be directly related to the attribute values they represent whereby small points \\ndenote small data values and large points denote large data values.  \\nSimilar to proportional symbols, range graded symbols group raw data into classes with each class \\nrepresented by a differently sized symbol. Both proportional and range graded symbols are most \\nfrequently used with point data, but lines and polygons can benefit from proportional symbolization as \\nwell. In the case of linear datasets, line width is most frequently used as the proportional visual variable. \\nPolygon datasets typically summarize a quantitative variable within each polygon, place a centroid within \\nthat polygon, and proportion that centroid point symbol. Range grading should not be used if the data \\nrange for a given variable is small. In these cases, range grading will suggest larger differences in the data \\nvalues than is merited. \\nThe advantage of proportional symbolization is the ease with which the viewer can discriminate symbol \\nsize and thus understand variations in the data values over a given map extent. On the other hand, \\nviewers may misjudge the magnitude of the proportional symbols if they do not pa y close attention to the \\nlegend. In addition, the human eye does not see and interpret symbol size in absolute terms. When \\nproportional circles are used in maps, it is typical that the viewer will underestimate the larger circles \\nrelative to the smaller circles. To address this potential pitfall, graduated symbols can be based on either \\nmathematical or perceptual scaling. Mathematical scaling directly relates symbol size with the data value \\nfor that locale. If one value is twice as large as another, it will be represented with a symbol twice as large \\nas the other. Perceptual scaling overcomes the underestimation of large symbols by making these symbols \\nmuch larger than their actual value would indicate (Figure 9.14 \"Mathematical versus Perceptual \\nScaling\"). \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  229 \\nFigure 9.14 Mathematical versus Perceptual Scaling \\n \\nA disadvantage of proportional symbolization is that the symbol size can appear variable depending on \\nthe surrounding symbols. This is best shown via the Ebbinghaus illusion (also known as Titchener \\ncircles). As you can see in Figure 9.15 \"Ebbinghaus Illusion\", the central circles are both the same size but \\nappear different due to the visual influence of the surrounding circles. If you are creating a graphic with \\nmany different symbols, this illusion can wreak havoc on the interpretability of your map.  \\nFigure 9.15 Ebbinghaus Illusion \\n \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  230 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Vector points, lines, and polygons can be symbolized in a variety of ways.

The objective of this section is to familiarize cartographers with the basic cartographic principles that \\ncontribute to effective map design. \\nIn addition to effective use of colors and symbols, a map that is well designed will greatly enhance its \\nability to relate pertinent spatial information to the viewer. Judicious use of map elements, \\ntypography/labels, and design principles will result in maps that minimize confusion and maximize \\ninterpretability. Furthermore, the use of these components must be guided by a keen understanding \\nof the map\u2019s purpose, intended audience, topic, scale, and production/reproduction method. \\nMap Elements \\nChapter 9 \"Cartographic Principles\", Section 9.1 \"Color\" and Section 9.2 \"Symbology\" discussed visual \\nvariables specific to the spatial features of a map. However, a map is composed of many more elements \\nthan just the spatial features, each of which contributes immensely to the interpretability and flow of the \\noverall map. This section outlines the basic map elements that should be incorporated into a \u201ccomplete\u201d \\nmap. Following Slocum et al. (2005), [1] these elements are listed in the logical order in which they should \\nbe placed into the map (Figure 9.16 \"A US Map Showing Various Map Elements\"). \\nThe first feature that should be placed into the map layout is the frame line. This line is essentially a \\nbordering box that surrounds all the map elements described hereafter. All of these map elements should \\nbe balanced within the frame line. To balance a map, ensure that neither large blank spaces nor jumbled \\nmasses of information are present within the map. Similar to frame lines are  neat lines. Neat lines are \\nborder boxes that are placed around individual map elements. By definition, neat lines must occu r within \\nthe frame line. Both frame lines and neat lines are typically thin, black -lined boxes, but they can be altered \\nto match the specific aesthetics of an individual map. \\nThe mapped area is the primary geographic component of the overall map. The mapped area contains all \\nof the features and symbols used to represent the spatial phenomena being displayed. The mapped area is \\ntypically bordered with a neat line. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  232 \\nInsets can be thought of as secondary map areas, each encased within their own neat line. These  neat lines \\nshould be of different thickness or type than other line features on the map to adequately demarcate them \\nfrom other map features. Insets often display the primary mapped area in relation to a larger area. For \\nexample, if the primary map shows the locales of national parks with a county, an inset displaying the \\nlocation of that county within the larger state boundary may be included. Conversely, insets are also used \\nto display areas related to the primary map but that occur at some far off local e. This type of inset is often \\nused with maps of the United States whereby Alaska and Hawaii are placed as insets to a map of the \\ncontiguous United States. Finally, insets can be used to clarify areas where features would otherwise be \\novercrowded if restricted to the primary mapping area. If the county map of national parks contained four \\nsmall, adjacent parks, an inset could be used to expand that jumbled portion of the map to show the exact \\nspatial extent of each of the four parks. This type of inset is frequently seen when showing the small \\nnortheastern states on a map of the entire United States. \\nAll maps should have a title. The title is one of the first map elements to catch the viewer\u2019s eye, so care \\nshould be taken to most effectively represent the intent of the map with this leading text. The title should \\nclearly and concisely explain the purpose of the map and should specifically target the intended viewing \\naudience. When overly verbose or cryptically abbreviated, a poor title will detract immensely from the \\ninterpretability of the cartographic end-product. The title should contain the largest type on the map and \\nbe limited to one line, if possible. It should be placed at the top-center of the map unless there is a specific \\nreason otherwise. An alternate locale for the title is directly above the legend. \\nThe legend provides a self-explanatory definition for all symbols used within the mapped area. Care must \\nbe taken when developing this map element, as a multitude of features within a dataset can lead to an \\noverly complex legend. Although placement of the legend is variable, it should be placed within the white \\nspace of the map and not in such a way that it masks any other map elements. Atop the legend box is the \\noptional legend header. The legend header should not simply repeat the information from the title, nor \\nshould it include extraneous, non-legend-specific information. The symbols representing mapped features \\nshould be to the left of the explanatory text. Placing a neat line around the legend will help to bring \\nattention to the element and is recommended but not required. Be careful not to take up too much of the \\nmap with the legend, while also not making the legend so small that it becomes difficult to read or that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  233 \\nsymbols become cluttered. Removing information related to base map features (e.g., state boundaries on a \\nUS map) or readily identifiable features (e.g., highway or interstate symbols) is one effective way to \\nminimize legend size. If a large legend is unavoidable, it is acceptable to plac e this feature outside of the \\nmap\u2019s frame line. \\nAttribution of the data source within the map allows users to assess from where the data are derived. \\nStylistically, the data source attribution should be hierarchically minimized by using a relatively small,  \\nsimple font. It is also helpful to preface this map element with \u201cSource:\u201d to avoid confusion with other \\ntypographic elements. \\nAn indicator of scale is invaluable to provide viewers with the means to properly adjudicate the \\ndimensions of the map. While not as important when mapping large or widely familiar locales such as a \\ncountry or continent, the scale element allows viewers to measure distances on the map. The three \\nprimary representations of scale are the representational fraction, verbal scale, and b ar scale (for more, \\nsee Chapter 2 \"Map Anatomy\", Section 2.1 \"Maps and Map Types\"). The scale indicator should not be \\nprominently displayed within the map as this element is of secondary importance.  \\nFinally, map orientation notifies the viewer of the direction of the map. To assist in clarifying orientation, \\na graticule can also be included in the mapped area. Most maps are made such that the top of the page \\npoints to the north (i.e., a north-up map). If your map is not north-up, there should be a good reason for \\nit. Orientation is most often indicated with a north arrow, of which there are many stylistic options \\navailable in current geographic information system (GIS) software packages. One of the most commonly \\nencountered map errors is the use of an overly large or overly ornate north arrow. North arrows should be \\nfairly inconspicuous as they only need to be viewed once by the reader. Ornate north arrows can be used \\non small scale maps, but simple north arrows are preferred on medium to large- scale maps so as to not \\ndetract from the presumably more important information appearing elsewhere.  \\nTaken together, these map elements should work together to achieve the goal of a clear, ordered, \\nbalanced, and unified map product. Since modern GIS packages allow users to add and remove these \\ngraphic elements with little effort, care must be taken to avoid the inclination to employ these Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  234 \\ncomponents with as little forethought as it takes to create them. The following sections provide further \\nguidance on composing these elements on the page to honor and balance the mapped area.  \\nFigure 9.16 A US Map Showing Various Map Elements \\n \\nTypography and Label Placement \\nType is found throughout all the elements of a map. Type is similar to map symbols in many senses. \\nColoring effects alter typographic hierarchy as lighter type fades into the background and dark type jumps \\nto the fore. Using all uppercase letters and/or bolded letters will result in more pronounced textual \\neffects. Larger font sizes increase the hierarchical weight of the type, so ensure that the size of the type \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  235 \\ncorresponds with the importance of the map feature. Use decorative fonts, bold, and italics sparingly. \\nThese fonts, as well as overly small fonts, can be difficult to read if overused. Most importantly, always \\nspell check your final cartographic product. After spell checking, spell check again. Yu wont reegrett teh \\necstra efort. \\nOther typographic options for altering text include the use of serif, sans serif, and display fonts. While the \\nuse of serif fonts are preferred in written documents to provide horizontal guidelines, either is acceptable \\nin a mapping application (Slocum 2005). [2] Sans serif fonts, on the other hand, are preferred for maps \\nthat are viewed over the Internet. \\nKerning is an effective typographic effect that alters the space between adjacent letters in a word. \\nDecreasing the kerning of a typeset is useful if the text is too large for the space given. Alternatively, \\nincreasing the kerning is an effective way to label large map areas, par ticularly in conjunction with all-\\nuppercase lettering. Like kerning, changes in leading (pronounced \u201cled-ing\u201d) alter the vertical distance \\nbetween lines of text. Leading should not be so cramped that lines of text begin to overwrite each other, \\nnor should it be so wide that lines of text appear unrelated. Other common typographic effects include \\nmasks, callouts, shadows, and halos (Figure 9.17 \"Typographic Effects\"). All of these effects serve to \\nincrease the visibility and importance of the text to which they are applied.  \\nFigure 9.17 Typographic Effects \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  236 \\nIn addition to the general typographic guidelines discussed earlier, there are specific typographic \\nsuggestions for feature labels. Obviously, labels must be placed proximal to their symbols so they are \\ndirectly and readily associated with the features they describe. Labels should maintain a consistent \\norientation throughout so the reader does not have to rubberneck about to read various entries. Also, \\navoid overprinting labels on top of other graphics or typographic features. If that is not possible, consider \\nusing a halo, mask, callout, or shadow to help the text stand out from the background. In the case of maps \\nwith many symbols, be sure that no features intervene between a symbol and its label.  \\nSome typographic guidelines are specific to labels for point, line, and polygon features. Point labels, for \\nexample, should not employ exaggerated kerning or leading. If leader lines are used, they should not \\ntouch the point symbol nor should they include arrow heads. Leader lines should always be represented \\nwith consistent color and line thickness throughout the map extent. Lastly, point labels should be placed \\nwithin the larger polygon in which they reside. For example, if the cities of Illinois were being map ped as \\npoints atop a state polygon layer, the label for the Chicago point symbol should occur entirely over land, \\nand not reach into Lake Michigan. As this feature is located entirely on land, so should its label.  \\nLine labels should be placed above their associated features but should not touch them. If the linear \\nfeature is complex and meandering, the label should follow the general trend of the feature and not \\nattempt to match the alignment of each twist and turn. If the linear feature is particularly lon g, the feature \\ncan be labeled multiple times across its length. Line labels should always read from left to right.  \\nPolygon labels should be placed within the center of the feature whenever possible. If increased emphasis \\nis desired, all-uppercase letters can be effective. If all-uppercase letters are used, exaggerated kerning and \\nleading is also appropriate to increase the hierarchical importance of the feature. If the polygon feature is \\ntoo small to include text, label the feature as if it were a point symbol. Unlike point labels, however, leader \\nlines should just enter into the feature. \\nMap Design Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  237 \\nMap design is a complex process that provides many variables and choices to the cartographer. The \\nBritish Cartographic Society Design Group presented five \u201cPrinciples of Cartographic Design\u201d on their \\nlistserv on November 26, 1999. These principles, and a brief summary of each, are as follows:  \\n1. Concept before compilation. A basic understanding of the concept and purpose of the map \\nmust be secured before the actual mapping exercise begins. Furthermore, there is no way to \\ndetermine what information to include in a map without having first determined who the end-\\nuser is and in what manner the map will be used. A map without a purpose is of no use to anyone.  \\n2. Hierarchy with harmony. Important map features must appear prominent on the map. The \\nless important features should fade into the background. Creating harmony between the primary \\nand secondary representations on the map will lead to a quality product that will best su it the \\nneeds for which it was developed. \\n3. Simplicity from sacrifice. Upon creating a map, it is tempting to add as much information \\ninto the graphic view as can possibly fit. In reality, it is best to leave some stones unturned. Just as \\nthe key to good communication is brevity, it can be said that the key to good mapping is \\nsimplicity. A map can be considered complete when no other features can be removed. Less, in \\nthis instance, is more. \\n4. Maximum information at minimum cost. The purpose of a map is to convey the greatest \\namount of information with the least amount of interpretive effort by the user. Map design should \\nallow complex spatial relationships to be understood at a glance. \\n5. Engage the emotion to engage the understanding. Well-constructed maps are basically \\nworks of art. All of the artistic and aesthetic rules outlined in this chapter serve to engage the \\nemotive center of the viewer. If the viewer does not formulate some basic, emotional response to \\nthe map, the message will be lost. \\nIt should become increasingly clear that the cartographic choices made during the mapping process have \\nas much influence on the interpretation of a map as does the data being mapped. Borrowing liberally from \\nthe popularized Mark Twain quote, it could be said that, \u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, \\nand maps.\u201d Mapmakers, indeed, have the ability to use (or misuse) cartographic principles to represent \\n(or misrepresent) the spatial data at their disposal.

GIS users typically start their careers performing low-end tasks such as digitizing vast \\nanalogue datasets or error checking voluminous metadata files. However, adept cartographers will \\nsoon find themselves promoted through the ranks and possibly into management positions. Here, \\nthey will be tasked with an assortment of business-related activities such as overseeing work groups, \\ninterfacing with clients, creating budgets, and managing workflows. As GISs become increasingly \\ncommon in today\u2019s business world, so too must cartographers become adept at managing GIS \\nprojects to maximize effective work strategies and minimize waste. Similarly, as GIS projects begin to \\ntake on more complex and ambitious goals, GIS project managers will only become more important \\nand integral to address the upcoming challenges of the job at hand. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  240 \\n10.1 Project Management Basics \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to achieve a basic understanding of the role of a project manager in the \\nlifecycle of a GIS project. \\nProject management is a fairly recent professional endeavor that is growing rapidly to keep pace with \\nthe increasingly complex job market. Some readers may equate management with the posting of \\nclich\u00e9d artwork that lines the walls of corporate headquarters across the nation (Figure 10.1). These \\nposters often depict a multitude of parachuters falling arm-in-arm while forming some odd \\ngeometric shape, under which the poster is titled \u201cTeamwork.\u201d Another is a beautiful photo of a \\nlandscape titled, \u201cMotivation.\u201d Clearly, any job that is easy enough that its workers can be motivated \\nby a pretty picture is a job that will either soon be done by computers or shipped overseas. In reality, \\nproper project management is a complex task that requires a broad knowledge base and a variety of \\nskills. \\nFigure 10.1 \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  241 \\nManagement is more than posting vapid, buzzword-laden artwork such as this in the office \\nplace. \\nThe Project Management Institute (PMI) Standards Committee describes project management as \\n\u201cthe application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet or \\nexceed stakeholder needs and expectations.\u201d To assist in the understanding and implementation of \\nproject management, PMI has written a book devoted to this subject titled, \u201cA Guide to the Project \\nManagement Body of Knowledge,\u201d also known as the PMBOK Guide (PMI 2008). This section guides \\nthe reader through the basic tenets of this text. \\nThe primary stakeholders in a given project include the project manager, project team, sponsor/client, \\nand customer/end-user. As project manager, you will be required to identify and solve potential \\nproblems, issues, and questions as they arise. Although much of this section is applicable to the \\nmajority of information technology (IT) projects, GIS projects are particularly challenging due to the \\nlarge storage, integration, and performance requirements associated with this particular field. GIS \\nprojects, therefore, tend to have elevated levels of risk compared to standard IT projects. \\nProject management is an integrative effort whereby all of the project\u2019s pieces must be aligned \\nproperly for timely completion of the work. Failure anywhere along the project timeline will result in \\ndelay, or outright failure, of the project goals. To accomplish this daunting task, \\nfive process groups and nine project management knowledge areas have been developed to meet \\nproject objectives. These process groups and knowledge areas are described in this section. \\nPMBOK Process Groups \\nThe five project management process groups presented here are described separately, but realize that \\nthere is typically a large degree of overlap among each of them.  \\nInitiation, the first process group, defines and authorizes a particular project o r project phase. This is the \\npoint at which the scope, available resources, deliverables, schedule, and goals are decided. Initiation is \\ntypically out of the hands of the project management team and, as such, requires a high -level \\nsponsor/client to approve a given course of action. This approval comes to the project manager in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  242 \\nform of a project charter that provides the authority to utilize organizational resources to address the \\nissues at hand. \\nThe planning process group determines how a newly initiated project phase will be carried out. It focuses \\non defining the project scope, gathering information, reviewing available resources, identifying and \\nanalyzing potential risks, developing a management plan, and estimating timetables and costs. As such, \\nall stakeholders should be involved in the planning process group to ensure comprehensive feedback. The \\nplanning process is also iterative, meaning that each planning step may positively or negatively affect \\nprevious decisions. If changes need to be made during these iterations, the project manager must revisit \\nthe plan components and update those now-obsolete activities. This iterative methodology is referred to \\nas \u201crolling wave planning.\u201d \\nThe executing process group describes those processes employed to compl ete the work outlined in the \\nplanning process group. Common activities performed during this process group include directing project \\nexecution, acquiring and developing the project team, performing quality assurance, and distributing \\ninformation to the stakeholders. The executing process group, like the planning process group, is often \\niterative due to fluctuations in project specifics (e.g., timelines, productivity, unanticipated risk) and \\ntherefore may require reevaluation throughout the lifecycle of the project. \\nThe monitoring and controlling process group is used to observe the project, identify potential problems, \\nand correct those problems. These processes run concurrently with all of the other process groups and \\ntherefore span the entire project lifecycle. This process group examines all proposed changes to the \\nproject and approves only those that do not alter the overall, stated goals of the project. Some of the \\nspecific activities and actions monitored and controlled by this process group include the  project scope, \\nschedule, cost, output quality, reports, risk, and stakeholder interactions.  \\nFinally, the closing process group essentially terminates all of the actions and activities undertaken during \\nthe four previous process groups. This process group includes handing off all pertinent deliverables to the \\nproper recipients and the formal completion of all contracts with the sponsor/client. This process group is \\nalso important to signal the sponsor/client that no more charges will be made, and they can n ow reassign \\nthe project staff and organizational resources as needed. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  243 \\nPMBOK Project Management Knowledge Areas \\nEach of the five aforementioned process groups is available for use with nine different knowledge areas. \\nThese knowledge areas comprise those subjects that project managers must be familiar with to \\nsuccessfully complete a given project. A brief description of each of these nine knowledge areas is \\nprovided here. \\n1. Project integration management describes the ability of the project manager to \u201cidentify, \\ndefine, combine, unify, and coordinate\u201d the various project activities into a coherent whole \\n(PMBOK 2008). It is understood by senior project managers that there is no single way to \\nsuccessfully complete this task. In reality, each manager must apply their specific skills, \\ntechniques, and knowledge to the job at hand. This knowledge area incorporates all five of the \\nPMBOK process groups. \\n2. Project scope management entails an understanding of not only what work is required to \\ncomplete the project but also what extraneous work should be excluded from project. Defining the \\nscope of a project is usually done via the creation of a scope plan document that is distributed \\namong team members. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n3. Project time management takes into account the fact that all projects are subject to certain \\ntime constraints. These time constraints must be analyzed and an overall pr oject schedule must \\nbe developed based on inputs from all project stakeholders (see Section 10.2.1 \"Scheduling\"  for \\nmore on scheduling). This knowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring \\nand controlling process groups. \\n4. Project cost management is focused not only with determining a reasonable budget for each \\nproject task but also with staying within the defined budget. Project cost management is often \\neither very simple or very complex. Particular care needs to be taken to work with th e \\nsponsor/client as they will be funding this effort. Therefore, any changes or augments to the \\nproject costs must be vetted through the sponsor/client prior to initiating those changes. This \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, as well as the monitoring and controlling process \\ngroups. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  244 \\n5. Project quality management identifies the quality standards of the project and determines \\nhow best to satisfy those standards. It incorporates responsibilities such as quality planning, \\nquality assurance, and quality control. To ensure adequate quality management, the project \\nmanager must evaluate the expectations of the other stakeholders and continually monitor the \\noutput of the various project tasks. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n6. Project human resource management involves the acquisition, development, organization, \\nand oversight of all team members. Managers should attempt to include team members in as \\nmany aspects of the task as possible so they feel loyal to the work and invested in creating the best \\noutput possible. This knowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and \\ncontrolling process groups. \\n7. Project communication management describes those processes required to maintain open \\nlines of communication with the project stakeholders. Included in this knowledge area is the \\ndetermination of who needs to communicate with whom, how communication will be maintained \\n(e-mail, letter reports, phone, etc.), how frequently contacts will be made, what barriers will limit \\ncommunication, and how past communications will be tracked and archived. This knowledge area \\nincorporates the planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling process groups.  \\n8. Project risk management identifies and mitigates risk to the project. It is concerned with \\nanalyzing the severity of risk, planning responses, and monitoring those identified risks. Risk \\nanalysis has become a complex undertaking as experienced project managers understand that \u201can \\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d Risk management involves working with all team \\nmembers to evaluate each individual task and to minimize the potential for that risk to manifest \\nitself in the project or deliverable. This knowledge area incorporates the plann ing, as well as the \\nmonitoring and controlling process groups. \\n9. Project procurement management, the final knowledge area, outlines the process by which \\nproducts, services, and/or results are acquired from outside the project team. This includes \\nselecting business partners, managing contracts, and closing contracts. These contracts are legal \\ndocuments supported by the force of law. Therefore, the fine print must be read and understood \\nto ensure that no confusion arises between the two parties entering into th e agreement. This Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  245 \\nknowledge area incorporates the planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing \\nprocess groups. \\nProject Failure \\nMurphy\u2019s Law of Project Management states that no major project is completed on time, within budget, \\nand with the same staff that started it\u2014 do not expect yours to be the first. It has been estimated that only \\n16 percent of fully implemented information technology projects are completed on time and within budget \\n(The Standish Group International 2000). [1] These failed projects result in an estimated loss of over $81 \\nbillion every year! David Hamil discusses the reasons for these failures in his web feature titled, \u201cYour \\nMission, Should You Choose to Accept It: Project Management Excellence\u201d \\n(http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/features/mesa1). \\nThe first noted cause for project failure is poor planning. Every project must undergo some type of \\nplanning-level feasibility study to determine the purpose of the project and the methodologies employed \\nto complete it. A feasibility study is basically used to determine whether or not a project should be given \\nthe \u201cgreen light.\u201d It outlines the project mission, goals, objectives, scope, and constraints. A project may \\nbe deemed unfeasible for a variety of reasons including an unacceptable level of risk, unclear project \\nrequirements, disagreement among clients regarding project objectives, missing key stakeholders, and \\nunresolved political issues. \\nA second cause for project failure is lack of corporate management support. Inadequate staffing and \\nfunding, as well as weak executive sponsorship on the part of the client, will typically result in a project \\nwith little chance of success. One of the most important steps in managing a project will be to determine \\nwhich member of the client\u2019s team is championing your project. This individual, or group of individuals, \\nmust be kept abreast of all major decisions related to the project. If the client\u2019s project champion loses \\ninterest in or contact with the effort, failure is not far afield. \\nA third common cause of project failure is poor project management. A high -level project manager should \\nhave ample experience, education, and leadership abilities, in addition to being a skilled negotiator, \\ncommunicator, problem solver, planner, and organizer. Despite the fact that managers with this wide -Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  246 \\nranging expertise are both uncommon and expensive to maintain, it only takes a failed project or two for a \\nclient to learn the importance of securing the proper person for the job at hand.  \\nThe final cause of project failure is a lack of client focus and the lack of the end -user participation. The \\nclient must be involved in all stages of the lifecycle of the project. More than on e GIS project has been \\ncompleted and delivered to the client, only to discover that the final product was neither what the client \\nenvisioned nor what the client wanted. Likewise, the end-user, which may or may not be the client, is the \\nmost important participant in the long-term survival of the project. The end-user must participate in all \\nstages of project development. The creation of a wonderful GIS tool will most likely go unused if the end -\\nuser can find a better and/or more cost-efficient solution to their needs elsewhere. \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 Project managers must employ a wide range of activities and actions to achieve the overall goals of the \\nproject. These actions are broken down into five process groups: initiation, planning, executing, \\nmonitoring and controlling, and closing. \\n\u2022 The activities and actions described in this section are applied to nine management knowledge areas that \\nmanagers must be cognizant of to ensure that all the goals of the project will be met: integration \\nmanagement, scope management, time management, cost management, quality management, human \\nresource management, communication management, risk management, and procurement management.  \\n\u2022 Projects can fail for a variety of reasons. Successful managers will be aware of these potential pitfal ls and \\nwill work to overcome them. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. As a student, you are constantly tasked with completing assignments for your classes. Think of one of \\nyour recent assignments as a project that you, as a project (assignment) manager, completed. Describe \\nhow you utilized a sampling of the project management process groups and knowledge areas to complete \\nthat assigned task. \\n \\n[1] The Standish Group International. 2000. \u201cOur Blog.\u201d http://www.pm2go.com. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  247 \\n10.2 GIS Project Management Tools and Techniques \\n \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE  \\n1. The objective of this section is to review a sampling of the common tools and techniques available to \\ncomplete GIS project management tasks. \\nAs a project manager, you will find that there are many tools and techniques that will assist your \\nefforts. While some of these are packaged in a geographic information system (GIS), many are not. \\nOthers are mere concepts that managers must be mindful of when overseeing large projects with a \\nmultitude of tasks, team members, clients, and end-users. This section outlines a sampling of these \\ntools and techniques, although their implementation is dependent on the individual project, scope, \\nand requirements that arise therein. Although these topics could be sprinkled throughout the \\npreceding chapters, they are not concepts whose mastery is typically required of entry-level GIS \\nanalysts or technicians. Rather, they constitute a suite of skills and techniques that are often applied \\nto a project after the basic GIS work has been completed. In this sense, this section is used as a \\nplatform on which to present novice GIS users with a sense of future pathways they may be led down, \\nas well as providing hints to other potential areas of study that will complement their nascent GIS \\nknowledge base. \\nScheduling \\nOne of the most difficult and dread-inducing components of project management for many is the need to \\noversee a large and diverse group of team members. While this text does not cover tips for getting along \\nwith others, ensuring that each project member is on task and up to date is an excellent way to reduce \\npotential problems associated with a complex project. To achieve this, there are several tools available to \\ntrack project schedules and goal completions. \\nThe Gantt chart (named after its creator, Henry Gantt) is a bar chart that is used specifically for tracking \\ntasks throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, Gantt charts show the dependencies of interrelated \\ntasks and focus on the start and completion dates for each specific task. Gantt charts will typically \\nrepresent the estimated task completion time in one color and the actual time to completion in a second Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  248 \\ncolor (Figure 10.2 \"Gantt Chart\"). This color coding allows project members to rapidly assess the project \\nprogress and identify areas of concern in a timely fashion. \\nFigure 10.2 Gantt Chart \\n \\nPERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts are similar to Gantt charts in that they are both \\nused to coordinate task completion for a given project (Figure 10.3 \"PERT Chart\"). PERT charts focus \\nmore on the events of a project than on the start and completion dates as seen with the Gantt charts. This \\nmethodology is more often used with very large projects where adherence to strict time guidelines is more \\nimportant than monetary considerations. PERT charts include the identification of the project\u2019s critical \\npath. After estimating the best- and worst-case scenario regarding the time to finish all tasks, the critical \\npath outlines the sequence of events that results in the longest potential duration for the project. Delays to \\nany of the critical path tasks will result in a net delay to project completion and therefore  must be closely \\nmonitored by the project manager. \\nFigure 10.3 PERT Chart \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  249 \\n \\nThere are some advantages and disadvantages to both the Gantt and PERT chart types. Gantt charts are \\npreferred when working with small, linear projects (with less than thirty or so  tasks, each of which occurs \\nsequentially). Larger projects (1) will not fit onto a single Gantt display, making them more difficult to \\nvisualize, and (2) quickly become too complex for the information therein to be related effectively. Gantt \\ncharts can also be problematic because they require a strong sense of the entire project\u2019s timing before the \\nfirst task has even been committed to the page. Also, Gantt charts don\u2019t take correlations between \\nseparate tasks into account. Finally, any change to the scheduling of the tasks in a Gantt chart results in \\nhaving to recreate the entire schedule, which can be a time-consuming and mind-numbing experience. \\nPERT charts also suffer from some drawbacks. For example, the time to completion for each individual \\ntask is not as clear as it is with the Gantt chart. Also, large project can become very complex and span \\nmultiple pages. Because neither method is perfect, project managers will often use Gantt and PERT charts \\nsimultaneously to incorporate the benefits of each methodology into their project. \\nWorking with CAD Data \\nWhile a GIS commands a large swath of the computer-generated mapping market share, it is not the only \\ncartographic player in town. GIS, as you now hopefully understand, is primarily a database -driven \\nmapping solution. Computer-aided design (CAD), on the other hand, is a graphics-based mapping \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  250 \\nsolution adopted by many cartographers; engineers in particular. Historically speaking, points, lines, and \\npolygons in a CAD system do not link to attributes but are mere drawings representing some reality. CAD \\nsoftware, however, has recently begun to incorporate \u201csmart\u201d features whereby attribute information is \\nexplicitly linked to the spatial representations. \\nCAD is typically used on many projects related to surveying and civil engineering work. For example, \\ncreating a cadastral map for a housing development is a complex matter with a fine scale of exactitude \\nrequired to ensure, for example, that all electrical, sewer, transportation, and gas lines meet at precise \\nlocales (Figure 10.4 \"CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project\"). An error of inches, in \\neither the vertical or horizontal dimension, could result in a need for a major plan redesign that may cost \\nthe client an inordinate amount of time and money. Too many of these types of errors, and you and your \\nengineer may soon be looking for a new job. \\n  Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  251 \\nFigure 10.4 CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project \\n \\nRegardless, the CAD drawing used to create these development plans is usually only concerned with the \\nlocal information in and around the project site that directly affects the construction of the housing units, \\nsuch as local elevation, soil/substrates, land-use/land-cover types, surface water flows, and groundwater \\nresources. Therefore, local coordinate systems are typically employed by the civil engineer whereby the \\norigin coordinate (the 0, 0 point) is based off of some nearby landmark such as a manhole, fire hydrant, \\nstake, or some other survey control point. While this is acceptable for engineers, the GIS user typically is \\nconcerned not only with local phenomena but also with tying the project into a larger world.  \\nFor example, if a development project impacts a natural watercourse in the state of California, agencies \\nsuch as the US Army Corps of Engineers (a nationwide government agency), California Department of \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  252 \\nFish and Game (a statewide government agency), and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (a local \\ngovernment agency) will each exert some regulatory requirements over the d eveloper. These agencies will \\nwant to know where the watercourse originates, where it flows to, where within the length of the \\nwatercourse the development project occurs, and what percentage of the watercourse will be impacted. \\nThese concerns can only be addressed by looking at the project in the larger context of the surrounding \\nwatershed(s) within which the project occurs. To accomplish this, external, standardized GIS datasets \\nmust be brought to bear on the project (e.g., national river reaches, stream f low and rain gauges, habitat \\nmaps, national soil surveys, and regional land-use/land-cover maps). These datasets will normally be \\ngeoreferenced to some global standard and therefore will not automatically overlay with the engineer\u2019s \\nlocal CAD data. \\nAs project manager, it will be your team\u2019s duty to import the CAD data (typically DWG, DGN, or DXF file \\nformat) and align it exactly with the other, georeferenced GIS data layers. While this has not been an easy \\ntask historically, sophisticated tools are being developed by both CAD and GIS software packages to \\nensure that they \u201cplay nicely\u201d with each other. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package contains a \\n\u201cGeoreferencing\u201d toolbar that allows users to shift, pan, resize, rotate, and add control points to assist in \\nthe realignment of CAD data. \\nApplication Development \\nAs project manager, you may discover that the GIS software package employed by your workgroup is \\nmissing some basic functionality that would greatly enhance the productivity of your team. In these cases, \\nit may be worthwhile to create your own GIS application(s). GIS applications are either stand -alone GIS \\nsoftware packages or customizations of a preexisting GIS software package that are made to meet some \\nspecific project need. These applications can range from simple (e.g., apply a standard symbol/color set \\nand text guidelines to mapped features) to complex (e.g., sort layers, select features based on a predefined \\nset of rules, perform a spatial analysis, and output a hard-copy map). \\nSome of the more simple applications can be created by using the canned tool sets and functionality \\nprovided in the GIS software. For example, ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software package includes a macro language \\ncalled Model Builder that allows users with no knowledge of programming  languages create a series of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  253 \\nautomated tasks, also called workflows, which can be chained together and executed multiple times to \\nreduce the redundancy associated with many types of GIS analyses. The more complex applications will \\nmost likely require the use of the GIS software\u2019s native macro language or to write original code using \\nsome compatible programming language. To return to the example of ESRI products, ArcGIS provides the \\nability to develop and incorporate user-written programs, called scripts, into to standard platform. These \\nscripts can be written in the Python, VBScript, JScript, and Perl programming languages.  \\nWhile you may want to create a GIS application from the ground up to meet your project needs, there are \\nmany that have already been developed. These pre-written applications, many of which are open source, \\nmay be employed by your project team to reduce the time, money, and headache associated with such an \\neffort. A sampling of the open-source GIS applications written for the C-family of programming languages \\nare as follows (Ramsey 2007): [1] \\n1. MapGuide Open Source (http://mapguide.osgeo.org)\u2014 A web-based application developed to \\nprovide a full suite of analysis and viewing tools across platforms \\n2.

Many of them incorporate open -source \\nshared libraries that perform functions such as format support, geoprocessing, and reprojection of \\ncoordinate systems. A sampling of these libraries is as follows: \\n1. GDAL/OGR (http://www.gdal.org)\u2014 \u201cGeospatial Data Abstraction Library/OpenGIS Simple \\nFeatures Reference Implementation\u201d is a compilation of translators for raster and vector \\ngeospatial data formats \\n2. Proj4 (http://proj.maptools.org)\u2014 A compilation of projection tools capable of transforming \\ndifferent cartographic projection systems, spheroids, and data points.  \\n3. GEOS (http://geos.refractions.net)\u2014 \u201cGeometry Engine, Open Source\u201d is a compilation of \\nfunctions for processing 2-D linear geometry \\n4. Mapnik (http://www.mapnik.org)\u2014 A tool kit for developing visually appealing maps from \\npreexisting file types (e.g., shapefiles, TIFF, OGR/GDAL) \\n5. FDO (http://fdo.osgeo.org)\u2014 \u201cFeature Data Objects\u201d is similar to, although more complex than, \\nGDAL/OGR in that it provides tools for manipulating, defining, translating, and analyzing \\ngeospatial datasets \\nWhile the C-based applications and libraries noted earlier are common due to their extensive time in \\ndevelopment, newer language families are supported as well. For example, Java has been used to develop \\nunique applications (e.g., gvSIG, OpenMap, uDig, Geoserver, JUMP, and DeeGree) from its l ibraries \\n(GeoAPI, WKB4J, GeoTools, and JTS Topology Suite), while .Net applications (e.g., MapWindow, \\nWorldWind, SharpMap) are a new but powerful application option that support their own libraries \\n(Proj.Net, NTS) as well as the C-based libraries. \\nMap Series \\nA project manager will often be required to produce paper and/or digital maps of the project site. These \\nmaps will typically include standard information such as a title, north arrow, scale bar, corporate contact \\ninformation, data source, and so forth. This is simple if the site is small enough that the pertinent mapped \\nfeatures can be resolved on a single map. However, problems arise if the site is exceedingly large, follows a \\nlinear pathway (e.g., highway improvement projects), or is composed of distant, noncontiguous site Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  255 \\nlocales. In these cases, the manager will need to create a series of easily referenced and reproduced maps \\nthat are at the exact same scale, have minimal overlap, and maintain consistent collar material \\nthroughout. \\nTo accomplish this task, a map series can be employed to create standar dized maps from the GIS (e.g., \\n\u201cDS Map Book\u201d for ArcGIS 9; \u201cData Driven Pages\u201d for ArcGIS 10). A map series is essentially a multipage \\ndocument created by dividing the overall data frame into unique tiles based on a user -\\ndefinedindex grid. Figure 10.5 \"Project Site Tiled into an Output Series\" shows an example of a map series \\nthat divides a project site into a grid of similar tiles. Figure 10.6 \"Output from a Map Series\"  shows the \\nstandardized maps produced when that series is printed. While these maps can certainly be created \\nwithout the use of a map series generator, this functionality greatly assists in the organization and display \\nof project\u2019s whose extents cannot be represented within a single map. \\nFigure 10.5 Project Site Tiled into an Output Series \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  256 \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nFigure 10.6 Output from a Map Series \\n \\nSource: Data available from U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science \\n(EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, SD. \\nGrid-to-Ground Transformations \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  257 \\nProject managers must be mindful of the transition from in-program mapped units to real-world \\nlocations. As discussed in Chapter 3 \"Data, Information, and Where to Find Them\", Section 3.2 \"Data \\nabout Data\", transforming the three-dimensional earth to two dimensions necessarily results in both \\naccuracy and precision errors. While projects that cover a small areal extent may not noticeably suffer \\nfrom this error, projects that cover a large areal extent could run into substantial problems. \\nWhen surveyors measure the angles and distances of features on the earth for input into a GIS, they are \\ntaking \u201cground\u201d measurements. However, spatial datasets in a GIS are based on a predefined coordinate \\nsystem, referred to as \u201cgrid\u201d measurements. In the case of angles, ground measurements are taken relative \\nto some north standard such as true north, grid north, or magnetic north. Grid measurements are always \\nrelative to the coordinate system\u2019s grid north. Therefore, grid north and ground north may well need to be \\nrotated in order to align correctly. \\nIn the case of distances, two sources of error may be present: (1) scale error and (2) elevation error. Scale \\nerror refers to the phenomenon whereby points measured on the three-dimensional earth (i.e., ground \\nmeasurement) must first be translated onto the coordinate system\u2019s ellipsoid (i.e., mean sea level), and \\nthen must be translated to the two-dimensional grid plane (Figure 10.7 \"Grid-to-Ground \\nTransformation\"). Basically, scale error is associated with the move from three to two dimensions and is \\nremedied by applying a scale factor (SF) to any measurements made to the dataset.  \\nFigure 10.7 Grid-to-Ground Transformation \\n \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  258 \\nIn addition to scale error, elevation error becomes increasingly pronounced as the project site\u2019s elevation \\nbegins to rise. Consider Figure 10.8 \"Grid versus Ground Measurements\", where a line measured as 1,000 \\nfeet at altitude must first be scaled down to fit the earth\u2019s ellipsoid measurement, then scaled again to fit \\nthe coordinate system\u2019s grid plane. Each such transition requires compensation, referred to as the \\nelevation factor (EF). The SF and EF are often combined into a single combination factor (CF) that is \\nautomatically applied to any measurements taken from the GIS. \\nFigure 10.8 Grid versus Ground Measurements \\n \\nIn addition to EF and SF errors, care must be taken when surveying areas greater than 5 miles in length. \\nAt these distances, slight errors will begin to compound and may create noticeable discrepancies. In \\nparticular, projects whose length crosses over coordinate systems zones (e.g., Universal Transverse \\nMercator [UTM] zones or State Plane zones) are likely to suffer from unacceptable grid -to-ground errors. \\nWhile the tools and techniques outlined in this section may be considered beyond the scope of an \\nintroductory text on GISs, these pages represent some of the concerns that will arise during your tenure as \\na GIS project manager. Although you will not need a comprehensive underst anding of these issues for \\nyour first GIS-related jobs, it is important that you understand that becoming a competent GIS user will \\nrequire a wide-ranging skill set, both technically and interpersonally. \\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  259 \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n\u2022 As project manager, you will need to utilize a wide variety of tools and techniques to complete your GIS \\nproject. \\n\u2022 The tools and techniques you employ will not necessarily be included as a part of your native GIS software \\npackage. In these cases, you will need to apply all project management r esources at your disposal. \\n \\nEXERCISE \\n1. Consider the following GIS project: You are contacted by the City of Miami to determine the effect of \\ninundation due to sea-level rise on municipal properties over the next hundred years. Assuming that the \\nsea level will rise one meter during that time span, describe in detail the process you would take to \\nrespond to this inquiry. Assuming you have two months to complete this task, develop a timeline that \\nshows the steps you would take to respond to the city\u2019s request. In your discussion, include information \\npertaining to the data layers (both raster and vector), data sources, and data attributes needed to address \\nthe problem. Outline some of the geoprocessing steps that would be required to convert your baseline \\nGIS data into project-specific layers that would address this particular problem. Upon completion of the \\ngeospatial analysis, how might you employ cartographic principals to most effectively present the data to \\ncity officials? Talk about potential problems that may arise during the analysis and discuss how you might \\ngo about addressing these issues. \\n \\n[1] Ramsey, P. 2007. \u201cThe State of Open Source GIS.\u201d Refractions \\nResearch.http://www.refractions.net/expertise/whitepapers/opensourcesurvey/survey -open-source-2007-12.pdf.'}\n"
