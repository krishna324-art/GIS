AI-Powered Knowledge Graph to Manim Animation Automation
Overview

This project automates the creation of educational videos from textbooks using AI and Manim. A user can input a concept, and the system will:

Search the book content for relevant information using semantic search.

Generate slides and narration from the retrieved text.

Convert the slides into an animated educational video using Manim.

Save slides as JSON and PowerPoint for reference.

The system can be applied to domains like GIS, Space Technology, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

Features

PDF to Text Extraction: Reads textbooks (PDF) and extracts content.

Semantic Search: Uses Sentence Transformers + FAISS to find relevant content for a user query.

Slide Generation: Creates structured slides with title, bullet points, and narration.

PPTX Export: Saves slides as PowerPoint for offline viewing.

Manim Video Animation: Converts slides into an animated educational video.

Dynamic Orchestration: User inputs a concept → receives slides + video automatically.

Technology Stack

Python Libraries: pypdf, sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, python-pptx, manim

Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from Sentence Transformers

Video Animation: Manim Community Edition v0.19.0

Optional Web Interface: Gradio / Streamlit for interactive queries

How It Works

Load PDF: Extract text from book.

Chunking: Split text into smaller concept chunks.

Embedding & Indexing: Convert chunks to embeddings and build FAISS index.

Query Search: Input a concept → retrieve top relevant chunks.

Slide Generation: Convert retrieved text into slides (title + bullets + narration).

Export Slides: Save as JSON and PPTX.

Render Video: Generate animated video using Manim.

Display/Share: Video can be displayed in Colab or a web interface.
